This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or gas, however some are electrically powered also.<p>

<h3>Understanding the Essentials of Furnace, AC and HVAC Maintenance at Robbinsville NJ</h3>
