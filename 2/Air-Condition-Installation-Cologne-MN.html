<p>Heating is the biggest energy expense in the typical home. In extremely dry climates, evaporative coolers, often referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during heat. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outdoors air through a damp pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The reasonable heat of the inbound air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is decreased. The temperature of the inbound air is decreased, but it is also more humid, so the total heat (reasonable heat plus hidden heat) is the same. A few of the reasonable heat of the entering air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The outcomes can be quite significant if the going into air is dry enough.<p>

<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor free gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the throat, nose, and eye and causes shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the threat of respiratory infection; there is likewise proof from animal research studies that repeated exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the development of lung illness such as emphysema. People at particular danger from exposure to nitrogen dioxide consist of kids and people with asthma and other respiratory illness.<p>
<p>People working in buildings with poor IAQ may see undesirable or moldy smells or may feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about symptoms that take place at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more serious problem. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ problems. If you have symptoms that are not disappearing or are worsening, speak to your doctor about them. However not all direct exposures cause signs, so there is no substitute for great building management.<p>
<p>If you have an older central air conditioner, you might select to change the outdoor compressor with a modern-day, high-efficiency unit. Consult a local heating and cooling contractor to ensure that the new compressor is effectively matched to the indoor unit if you do so. However, thinking about recent modifications in refrigerants and cooling styles, it may be wiser to change the entire system.<p>
