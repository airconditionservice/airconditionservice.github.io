In really dry climates, evaporative coolers, often described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outdoors air through a damp pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The reasonable heat of the incoming air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature of the incoming air is minimized, however it is also more humid, so the total heat (sensible heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. A few of the practical heat of the going into air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the getting in air is dry enough, the results can be rather significant.<p>
