<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel frequently receives requests for consultation and assistance in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal agencies. During the 1970s, many homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation measure. However, much of these homes were discovered to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this product. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was set up many years earlier are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
