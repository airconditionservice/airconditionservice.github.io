<p>It is common to presume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady over time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a building as relatively the same physical material in time. In fact, the true nature of structures can be deemed the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and understood as intricate systems. Research using the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of environments can assist increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the developed environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
