<p>Changing a capacitor is simple. Simply take a picture of the wires before detaching anything (you may need a recommendation later). Then release the kept energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp connectors should snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. Remove the port and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. When you've swapped all the wires, secure the new capacitor (Picture 5).<p>
