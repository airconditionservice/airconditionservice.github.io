<h3>Ductwork Repair and Replacement in Pierce City MO</h3>
<p>If you think a mold issue-- either because of visible development or a musty odor regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much great if it doesn't get rid of the mold. Mold begins with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can preserve and check. Leaking return ducts can also present wetness. Once again, if you suspect a mold issue, consider having a service company inspect the duct system for leakages.<p>

<p>While these actions will help to keep your AC system in top shape, be aware that there are maintenance products that only a qualified HVAC technician will have the ability to do. For example, a slow refrigerant leakage in your AC system can result in costly compressor failure, but a house owner does not have the abilities or tools necessary to check refrigerant levels. Likewise, tidy ducts and proper air flow are necessary to a well-functioning system, but house owners lack the required equipment for the job. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a savvy house owner, it's still necessary to have an expert technician check the system periodically.<p>

<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a need for air conditioner repair, which you should keep an eye out for. First, you must check your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little unreasonable, but ice on your air conditioning unit can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately if completely iced over.<p>
