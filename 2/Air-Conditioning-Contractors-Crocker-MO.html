<p>Recent Review: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He made the effort to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and polite. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
