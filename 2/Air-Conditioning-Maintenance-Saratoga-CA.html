Where a geothermal HVAC taps into the heat inside the earth for area heating, cooling or for heating one's supply of water, geothermal energy is the process by which the heat inside the earth is utilized for generating power in the form of electrical power. The 2 operations utilize different processes, with geothermal energy requiring water be warmed to boiling point to achieve its aims.<p>
