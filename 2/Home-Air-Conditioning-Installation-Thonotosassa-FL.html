<p>Evaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working throughout times of high humidity, when there is very little dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for home occupants. Unlike other types of a/c, evaporative coolers depend on the outside air to be funnelled through cooler pads that cool the air before it reaches the inside of a home through its air duct system; this cooled outside air needs to be enabled to press the warmer air within your house out through an exhaust opening such as an open door or window. 36 These coolers cost less and are mechanically basic to preserve and comprehend.<p>
