<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent job finding the outdoor system as near the house as possible per my request. The job took two days and my backyard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely well-informed of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained till 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<h3>The Way to Choose An HVAC Company in Laguna Woods CA</h3>
<p>Elements that can add to the development of biological pollutants are moist or wet structure materials (carpets, ceilings, walls) and inadequately kept humidifiers, dehumidifiers, and air conditioners. "Humidifier fever" is a typical health problem brought on by incorrect maintenance of humidifiers that can produce fever, chills, headaches, and consistent coughs. Numerous fungis and bacteria grow rapidly in the warm, stagnant water inside humidifiers. During operation, these pollutants can be distributed into the air and inhaled by the building residents. Other possible sources of biological contaminants are pets and household plants.<p>
<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most common mix used in cars in the U.S. up until 1994, when most designs altered to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting potential of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer made in the U.S. for this kind of application, but is still imported and can be bought and utilized by certified HVAC technicians. For systems needing just an occasional "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in good working order and performing far better than practically all "R-134a" systems whether "converted" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is thought about "cheap" by numerous people.<p>
