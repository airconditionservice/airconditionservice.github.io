<p>My eldest child constantly grumbled about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a new one. For some time I dismissed him but then I understood that it truly didnâ $ t disperse air like it did before. Weâ $ ve had the important things for 16 years so I didnâ $ t really think about anything else except changing it. The one I got is worth every penny. The noise level is low and itâ $ s fantastic on energy conserving too.<p>
<p>When the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high sufficient temperature, a blower fan will start to introduce air to a heat exchanger.
