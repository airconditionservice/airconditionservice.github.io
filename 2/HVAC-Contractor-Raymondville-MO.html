<p>My eldest child constantly grumbled about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a new one. For some time I dismissed him but then I understood that it truly didnÃ¢ $ t disperse air like it did before. WeÃ¢ $ ve had the important things for 16 years so I didnÃ¢ $ t really think about anything else except changing it. The one I got is worth every penny. The noise level is low and itÃ¢ $ s fantastic on energy conserving too.<p>
<p>When the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high sufficient temperature, a blower fan will start to introduce air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger enables air to be heated without being available in contact with the real flame or burner location. Once it reaches a sufficient temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the house's duct, supplying warm air to private bedrooms, living spaces and kitchens through the vents or registers.<p>
