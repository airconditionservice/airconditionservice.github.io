<p>Information provided in this security guide is based upon present scientific and technical understanding of the problems presented and is reflective of the jurisdictional limits developed by the statutes governing the co-authoring agencies. The standards do not require you to alter your existing central air conditioning systems, and replacement parts and services need to still be readily available for your home's systems. The "life-span" of a central air conditioner has to do with 15 to twenty years. Producers normally continue to support existing equipment by making replacement parts readily available and honoring maintenance contracts after the new standard goes into result.<p>
<p>Radiant heating covers a range of different heating systems, consisting of electric heating units and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heat systems run on comparable concepts. When it comes to a boiler, the system heats up by distributing hot water through a series of pipelines set up in the sub-floor of each room. In the case of electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating components. As the hot water (or electricity) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the flooring and into the space.<p>

<p>Free cooling systems can have really high effectiveness, and are in some cases integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be utilized for summer season air conditioning. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heatpump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in due to the fact that the storage acts as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
