<p>When installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external system to the internal ones, the main issue. While setting up a separate split system, workers try to locate both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Installing a multi-split system produces more difficulties, because a few of indoor systems can be situated far from the outside. The first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not enable you to set the cooling separately for each room. However, now the market has a wide choice of multi-split systems, in which the practical characteristics of indoor systems operate individually from each other.<p>
