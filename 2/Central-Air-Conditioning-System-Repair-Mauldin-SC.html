<h3>The Basics of Central Heating and Air Conditioning in Mauldin SC</h3>
<p>All modern air conditioning systems, even little window plan units, are equipped with internal air filters. These are normally of a light-weight gauze-like material, and must be replaced or washed as conditions warrant. For example, a building in a high dust environment, or a house with furry family pets, will require to have the filters altered more often than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as required will add to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to wasted energy, reduced equipment life, and greater energy bills; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air circulation. In addition, really unclean or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or even fire.<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't lucrative you would not offer them.. Secondly like extended auto service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is truly unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the necessary skills to do the job and also the morals to deal with consumers fairly. As a customer you need to be well notified in order not to be totally made the most of. Most companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to offer new versus repair. Lastly found someone to appropriately service and the unit has actually been operating issue totally free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
