<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Just take a photo of the wires before disconnecting anything (you might need a referral in the future). Then discharge the saved energy in the old capacitor (Image 4).

The female crimp connectors must snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. Remove the connector and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. When you've swapped all the wires, protect the new capacitor (Picture 5).<p>
