<p>Examine these 3 things first if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make sure all the signs up in the house are wide open. Then make sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outside and clean off the condenser coils (Photo 2). The reduced air flow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if a number of signs up were closed or the filter was obstructed. Deice the A-coil if you have actually altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or till there's good airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to test it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually resolved the issue.<p>
