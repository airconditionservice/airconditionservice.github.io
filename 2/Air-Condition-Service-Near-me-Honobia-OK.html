This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered also.<p>

<p>I typically don't leave evaluations however wished to share my experience. You do not expect needing to change your AC unit. Sadly for us, we had no other alternative. What made me opt for this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert going over my options. After company hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and discuss choices. I scheduled my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a household pal and now I will recommend this company to my buddies.<p>
