These convection heating units are still extensively utilized and are generally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is typically oil or natural gas, but some are electrically powered too.<p>

<p>The majority of central air conditioning conditioners are linked to a home's forced-air distribution system. Thus, the same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are utilized to distribute cool air from the air conditioning system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is running, hot air inside the house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool the house. When the air conditioning unit works but your house does not cool, the issue is most likely in the distribution system.<p>
