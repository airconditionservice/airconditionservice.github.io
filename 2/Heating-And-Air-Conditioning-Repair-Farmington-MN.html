Your transformer converts the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends out power to your typical wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency security changes that secure your air conditioning system from flooding. One of the most common locations for emergency ac repair midtown Tx security switches is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. It is a great opportunity; you may have a water leakage in the attic if your Nest is showing a blank screen. The water activates your emergency safety switch, hence cutting power to your HVAC transformer. This shuts off all the 24 volts going to your furnace. There is also a baseplate that links to the Nest. We have actually seen baseplate spoil on uncommon occasions.<p>
