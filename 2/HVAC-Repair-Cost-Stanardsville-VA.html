<p>When our furnace was dying, we called 2 local companies for quotes. While both were useful and helpful, Ballard Natural Gas gave us a much better offer, for remarkable service. Instead of a basic sales task, the owner of the company made a full evaluation of our heating unit and situated methods we could have more even heat. He included these considerable but minor changes in his bid. Due to the fact that of recent warmer summer seasons and for environmental factors, we decided to change from a gas furnace to an electric heat pump.<p>
