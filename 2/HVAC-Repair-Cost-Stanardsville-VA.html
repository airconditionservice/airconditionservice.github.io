<p>When our furnace was dying, we called 2 local companies for quotes. While both were useful and helpful, Ballard Natural Gas gave us a much better offer, for remarkable service. Instead of a basic sales task, the owner of the company made a full evaluation of our heating unit and situated methods we could have more even heat.
