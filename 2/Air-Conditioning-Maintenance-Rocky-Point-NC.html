<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might think. Due to the fact that a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet.

But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to use and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
