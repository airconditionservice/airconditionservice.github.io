<p>A/c can likewise be provided by a process called free cooling which utilizes pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heatpump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is included due to the fact that the temperature of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, thus declining its efficiency.<p>
