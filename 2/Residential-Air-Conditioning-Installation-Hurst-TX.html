<p>Immediate discounts on high-efficiency heatpump technologies are available to equipment installers, applied at the wholesaler or distributor point-of-purchase. Excellent Customer Support! Climate Pro is trusted and truly cared about us and our circumstance. We came home one night to a cold house. I called Climate Pro, and Warren came over that same night. Although he didn't have the required replacement part in his van, he adjusted his schedule so he might look for and buy it the next morning. Less than 24 hours after I called him, I was absolutely glad to have a heated home once again. What's most incredible was that this all occurred during Thanksgiving week! I wasn't sure we 'd find someone to help us right before a vacation, but Environment Pro came through for us. I will happily suggest this company to my friends.<p>

Particulates and irritants discovered in outdoor air can be asthma triggers. Filtering inbound air for HVAC systems effectively filters particulates. Professionals suggest using filters with a MERV 6-8, however higher MERV levels trap smaller particles and generally are better for those with allergic reactions or where the indoor environment has a high concentration of mold spores, dust particles, or other allergens.<p>
