<p>As a number of you pointed out, preventative maintenance is needed by all significant equipment maker's to guarantee your factory warranties stay in place. In addition, the tangible results of a PM is frequently difficult to quantify, as one response mentioned the savings in efficiency or repairs that were prevented. A lot of pieces of a furnace or a/c don't just break at the snap of a finger, but instead is the result of repeated use of a part that runs out balance. For example, a heat exchanger may stop working prematurely because the gas pressure was operating to high, cooking the metal and triggering premature deterioration, leading to holes and cracks. If that client had actually received a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure stays in line and safeguards the component.  a very beneficial result and one that was no cost at the time of service, but one that possibly saved a customer thousands.<p>
