<p>Current Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

This cooled air ends up being warmer as it circulates through the home; then it recedes to the central air conditioner through return ducts and registers.
