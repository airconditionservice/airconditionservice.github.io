<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) refers to air quality in indoor workplace, classroom or laboratory environments, instead of industrial or outside settings. In tasks where union membership is not a concern, an HVAC technician may complete the assembly and installation of the ductwork that disperses the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system. This includes cutting the sheet metal to form the ducts, connecting the ducts to the HVAC system, and mounting the ductwork in the structure. It might also include the installation of registers where the ductwork connects to private areas.<p>
<p>More common in reasonably older homes, a boiler-based heating system utilizes gas, oil or electricity to heat water and produce steam that moves through pipelines to heat radiators in specific rooms. All-electric boilers can achieve as much as 95 to 100 percent AFUE, according to the DOE. More recent gas boilers should achieve 80 percent AFUE and more recent fossil-fueled boilers must achieve a 75 percent AFUE.<p>
