The technician invested a good amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
