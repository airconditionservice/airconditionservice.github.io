<p>How environment change affects air quality and exposure to air pollutants.

This boost has the effect that, for each system of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioning system eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the a/c unit need to increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "efficiency" (coefficient of performance) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is activated, and the air conditioning unit has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The a/c's power intake will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, thus making the 100 W heating element cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
