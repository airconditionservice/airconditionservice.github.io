<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider because the two specialists I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts.
