<p>To put this merely, Preventative maintenance is IMPORTANT TO maintain the effectiveness and performance of your HVAC system, multiple studies through DOE and ACCA can verify this if you're interested. However, choose your contractor wisely, a number of the 'trustworthy' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to improper sales strategies that DO benefit from uninformed homeowners. Again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid site with an agenda. While Angie's list is a great base line indication that you MIGHT be working with a trusted company, you still should do your homework (not all contractors with a comparable score are the very same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (Air conditioning contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a need for air conditioning unit repair, which you should keep an eye out for. First, you must examine your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little unreasonable, but ice on your ac system can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly if completely iced over.<p>
