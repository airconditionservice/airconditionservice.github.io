<p>Info supplied in this safety guide is based on existing clinical and technical understanding of the concerns presented and is reflective of the jurisdictional limits established by the statutes governing the co-authoring agencies. The requirements do not require you to alter your existing central air conditioning units, and replacement parts and services should still be offered for your home's systems.
