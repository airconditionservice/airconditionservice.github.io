<p>A Lot Of Midtown Houston Tx consumers don't understand why their HVAC system is not working when they position a 24 hr emergency ac repair demand. If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outdoors system we'll be frozen too. Depending upon how thick the ice accumulation is at your condensing system, then you'll have an excellent concept of how thick the ice build-up remains in the evaporator coil. The very first thing you need to do is to inspect your conditioning filters. If your filter is dirty, you're in luck, that's most likely your issue. If you discovered that your conditioning filter requires changing, then the next action is to defrost your cooling devices. The most convenient way to thaw your HVAC devices is to leave the unit off for a couple of hours, with the blower fan running.<p>
