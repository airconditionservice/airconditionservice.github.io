<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a requirement for air conditioner repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. First, you ought to inspect your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little ridiculous, however ice on your air conditioning system can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly.<p>
