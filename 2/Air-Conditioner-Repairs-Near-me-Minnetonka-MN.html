<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may think. Since many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive flexible hose pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to tear and use and is easily pierced.<p>

<p>Normally the most effective method to improve indoor air quality is to eliminate individual sources of pollution or to decrease their emissions. Some sources, like those which contain asbestos, can be sealed or confined; others, like gas ranges, can be gotten used to reduce the amount of emissions. In many cases, source control is likewise a more cost-efficient approach to securing indoor air quality than increasing ventilation due to the fact that increasing ventilation can increase energy costs. Specific sources of indoor air contamination in your home are noted later in this area.<p>
