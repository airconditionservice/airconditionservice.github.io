<p>When your Volvo no longer keeps you cool- offer All Vovo a call! Heat pumps work extremely well in temperate climates like King and South Snohomish counties. Working on electricity, a heatpump is a cost-effective solution utilizing a refrigeration cycle like that which cools your fridge, but in reverse. Instead of warming or cooling the air currently inside your home, it draws heat or cool from the air outside and pushes it through the ventilation system of your home.<p>
<p>The factor for keeping the heat source low is simple. Heat increases, so it makes sense to locate the heat source at the flooring level. This lets the heat naturally travel through the hot" zone, which is from a person's toe to head area. All objects in the hot zone reach balance in temperature after the radiant heat system has been running for a while, including individuals. When the furnace kicks in and that abrupt shot of coolness when it shuts off, gone is that rush of hot air.<p>

<p>. The compressor-based refrigerant systems are air-cooled, indicating they utilize air to exchange heat, in the very same method as a cars and truck radiator or typical family air conditioning unit does. Such a system dehumidifies the air as it cools it. It collects water condensed from the cooled air and produces hot air which should be vented outside the cooled location; doing so transfers heat from the air in the cooled location to the outside air.<p>
