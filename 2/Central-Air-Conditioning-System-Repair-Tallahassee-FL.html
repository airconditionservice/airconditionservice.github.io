<p>Trace was the service technician that looked after my semi annual maintenance today. Trace was on time, polite, and respected my home by always wearing boot coverings when entering my house. He demonstrated the points of assessment and likewise advised I have a UV light set up due to a small accumulation of mold accumulating in the air handler, which he thoroughly inspected and cleaned the outside compressor coils along with ensured the moisture discharge tube was clear by utilizing a cleaning liquid and a shop vacuum.

<p>I had a dreadful experience with an HVAC company that charged $8,519 for setting up a furnace cost $1,300. In addition, the company utilized 98% of the existing product purchased with the house. This company presented a service agreement contract to offer service to heating, electrical and plumbing. Throughout the assessment on a very cold day they killed the furnace claiming health danger factor and contractor laws for their choice. As a brand-new home owner I have discovered how to recognize the sincere HVAC company vs the HVAC snakes.<p>
