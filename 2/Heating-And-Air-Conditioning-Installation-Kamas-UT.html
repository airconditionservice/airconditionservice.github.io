The size of geothermal heat pump and the size of ground loop needed depends on the cooling and heating requirements for your home and is crucial iin ensuring the efficiency and efficiency of the system. Capability for geothermal systems is measured in tons. Normally, a 3-ton setup should be enough for the average home, however house size, heating and cooling requirements, local geology and soil, and land availability are all factors which will influence the appropriate size for your particular home.
