<p>If you are changing your current cooling system, it's safe to assume that you currently have ductwork set up. Ductwork provides the conditioned air from your HVAC system throughout your house through vents frequently found in your house's attic and However, with time ductwork can lose its' performance or may need to be altered to work with your new AC system. New ductwork installation can tack on an additional cost anywhere from $1,200 to $4,200 depending upon the level of complexity to modify or set up. Plan to include a couple of days of labor to your HVAC replacement job if you do need ductwork replacement.<p>
