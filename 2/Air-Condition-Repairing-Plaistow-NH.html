<p>Geothermal heating is among the most effective heating sources in terms of ecological costs. Because the energy utilized to heat your home is drawn out directly from the ground, it protects the environment from harmful digging, fracking, or toxins.

While geothermal systems do use some electrical power, they launch far less greenhouse gases or other toxins than heating systems that need gas, oil, or electric heat.<p>
