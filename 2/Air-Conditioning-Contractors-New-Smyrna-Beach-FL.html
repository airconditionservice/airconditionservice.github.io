Improperly located outside air consumption vents can also bring in air infected with automobile and truck exhaust, boiler emissions, fumes from dumpsters, or air vented from toilets.

<p>Irritants are products that cause an immune-type response in individuals who are sensitized to these products. Irritants found in indoor air are mainly biological product such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect pest particles, pollen, bacteria, and mold. All of these products are little particles, can end up being air-borne, and therefore, are easily inhaled. Allergens that are inhaled by sensitized people with asthma can trigger asthma attacks. For instance, if you think about a group of individuals with asthma, the presence of feline irritant could bring on an asthma attack in people with cat allergies, however not in those people who do not have feline allergic reactions.<p>
<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a need for ac system repair, which you must keep an eye out for. First, you need to inspect your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little absurd, however ice on your a/c can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
