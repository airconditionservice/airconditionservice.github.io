<p>Information offered in this safety guide is based upon present scientific and technical understanding of the problems presented and is reflective of the jurisdictional limits established by the statutes governing the co-authoring companies. Structures constantly develop as an outcome of the changes in the environment around them as well as the occupants, products, and activities within them. The different surfaces and the air inside a building are constantly connecting, and this interaction results in changes in each. For example, we may see a window as changing slightly in time as it becomes unclean, then is cleaned, builds up dirt again, is cleaned once again, and so on through its life. In fact, the dirt" we see might be evolving as a result of the interactions amongst the moisture, chemicals, and biological materials discovered there.<p>
<p>When filters aren't replaced or cleaned routinely, they can become clogged with particles that can restrict air flow, potentially impacting your comfort and your system's performance. Dirty filters can trigger extra wear and tear on furnace parts and in more severe cases cause the system to close down totally. By contrast, checking and replacing a furnace filter can normally be performed in just a couple of minutes, frequently with no tools needed. As a preventative measure, before cleaning your furnace filter, be sure to turn off the furnace either at the thermostat or utilizing the power switch, normally installed on the side of the furnace.<p>
