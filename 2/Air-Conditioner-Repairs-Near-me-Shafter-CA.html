<h3>Benefits of Professional AC Repair in Shafter CA</h3>
<p>Luis was quickly responsive to email and texts with questions. He committed to the task based just on emails, showed up and delivered with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs deal was one of the couple of affordable ones received. Others were almost twice the quantity Protex priced quote for low end off brand name devices. I got Carrier. ProTex correctly recommended me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser despite the fact that it would have made them more money (Sincerity) The install team was considerate of my house and set up the equipment in the anticipated amount of time. post set up evaluation outcomes look very good for braising and pipes quality. New unit cools better than the 13 year old 4 ton R22 system it replaced (also Carrier).<p>
<p>When all the tasks have been completed, the last task is to check the system to make sure it cools effectively. HVAC systems are operated through the thermostat.
