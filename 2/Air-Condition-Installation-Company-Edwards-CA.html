In some cases, measured particle levels really increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced instantly after cleaning however went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>

Lastly discovered someone to effectively service and the system has been operating issue complimentary for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
