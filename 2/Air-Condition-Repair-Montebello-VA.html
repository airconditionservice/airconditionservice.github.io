<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier because the two professionals I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
