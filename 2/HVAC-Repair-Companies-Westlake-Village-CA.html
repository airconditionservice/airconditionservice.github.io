<p>Seattle heating systems can run 9 months of the year. Based on the typical temperature levels in our area, if you compared running your furnace to an automobile it would get the equivalent of 1.8 million miles over its anticipated life expectancy of 15 years. Your heating system will work hard for you, however like your automobile, doing routine and regular maintenance will keep it running smoothly, prevent problems, and keep your service warranty intact.<p>
<p>In addition, worker health symptoms such as colds, headaches, sleepiness, inflammation, and irregular breathing might be caused as the result of temperature level extremes, inappropriate humidity levels, and insufficient or too much air circulation. Work environment temperature levels ought to be kept between 68 degrees- 75 degrees Fahrenheit and humidity levels in between 30%- 60%. In addition, drafts brought on by too much air blood circulation should be avoided.<p>
<p>Generally the most effective method to improve indoor air quality is to eliminate individual sources of pollution or to minimize their emissions. Some sources, like those which contain asbestos, can be sealed or confined; others, like gas ranges, can be adjusted to reduce the quantity of emissions. In many cases, source control is likewise a more affordable method to securing indoor air quality than increasing ventilation because increasing ventilation can increase energy expenses. Particular sources of indoor air pollution in your house are listed later on in this section.<p>
<p>Second, identification of impurity sources is frequently crucial to determining the cause( s) of employee health signs. Such info can sometimes be gotten by requesting copies of air tracking information from the company. If keeping track of information is not readily available, yet a high number of health signs have been reported, the Union representative must request that the company have air monitoring tests conducted. Evaluation of this information might identify potentially hazardous sources of contamination and resultant worker health signs. However, when pollutant concentrations are very low, keeping an eye on data may not explain the observed or reported health symptoms.<p>
