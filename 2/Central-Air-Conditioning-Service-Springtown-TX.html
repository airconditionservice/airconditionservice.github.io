<p>Radiant heat covers a variety of different heating unit, including electric heating units and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heat systems operate on comparable concepts. In the case of a boiler, the system heats up by dispersing warm water through a series of pipes set up in the sub-floor of each room. In the case of electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating components. As the hot water (or electrical power) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the flooring and into the space.<p>
