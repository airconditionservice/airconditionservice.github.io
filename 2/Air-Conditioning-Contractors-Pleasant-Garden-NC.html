<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Proper ventilation assists enhance indoor air quality. It's simple to think that the air quality exterior is worse than the air quality inside. We know about air pollution and acid rain, we can see smoke and odor exhaust, and we might even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck spew thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air pollutants are typically 2 to 5 times greater than outside levels, and in many cases these levels can exceed 100 times that of outside levels of the very same toxins. To put it simply, in some cases the air inside can be more damaging than the air exterior.<p>
<p>When filters aren't replaced or cleaned frequently, they can end up being obstructed with debris that can limit airflow, possibly impacting your comfort and your system's performance. Dirty filters can trigger additional wear and tear on furnace components and in more severe cases trigger the system to shut down completely. By contrast, replacing a furnace and examining filter can normally be carried out in just a few minutes, typically without any tools needed. As a preventative measure, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, make certain to shut off the furnace either at the thermostat or utilizing the power switch, usually mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>

<p>A lot of central air conditioners are linked to a home's forced-air distribution system. Therefore, the same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are used to distribute cool air from the a/c system. When a central air conditioner is operating, hot air inside your house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your house. When the a/c unit works however the house doesn't cool, the issue is probably in the distribution system.<p>

<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't rewarding you wouldn't provide them.  Second of all like extended vehicle service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is actually unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the necessary skills to do the task and likewise the morals to deal with consumers fairly. As a consumer you need to be well notified in order not to be entirely made the most of. Many companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to properly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to offer new versus repair. Lastly discovered somebody to appropriately service and the system has actually been operating problem free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
