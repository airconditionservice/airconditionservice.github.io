<p> Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & Air Conditioning company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Sound given that 1978. If your ac system is low on refrigerant, either it was undercharged at installation or it leakages. If it leakages, just adding refrigerant is not an option. A qualified technician needs to fix any leak, test the repair, and after that charge the system with the proper amount of refrigerant.

<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
