<p>The compressor can get too hot and shut down if the condenser coils are obstructed. You'll experience intermittent periods of very little cooling, followed by no cooling. Even if you're sure" the condenser coils are tidy, clean them once again. Turn off the power. Flip the air conditioning service and furnace breaker in your main electrical panel to the Off" position. Next, switch off the power switch right at the furnace or air handler. Then tug the detach block (Photo 1) and clean the condenser coils (Photo 2). If the air conditioning service still doesn't work effectively after you've cleaned the condenser coils, installed a new filter and opened all the supply vents, continue with the following repairs. Your AC will not work totally unless you do this.<p>
