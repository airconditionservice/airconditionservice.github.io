<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a requirement for ac system repair, which you must look out for. Initially, you must inspect your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little unreasonable, however ice on your air conditioner can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively if entirely iced over.<p>
