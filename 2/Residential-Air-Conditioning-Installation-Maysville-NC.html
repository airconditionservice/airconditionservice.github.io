<p>The directions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfy completing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the new breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrician. We recommend you do the very same. As soon as the circuitry is complete, stimulate the system for a few minutes to make certain the controls work and resistance cable television heats. Don't put the system into complete operation up until the thin-set and grout have actually had time to properly treat and harden-- typically two to four weeks. Then call the family together and play a video game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm restroom flooring.<p>
<p>Carbon monoxide gas (CO) is an odorless, colorless hazardous gas. Because it is impossible to see, smell or taste, CO can kill you before you understand it remains in your home. At lower levels of direct exposure, CO causes moderate effects that are often mistaken for the flu. These symptoms include headaches, lightheadedness, nausea, fatigue and disorientation. The impacts of CO direct exposure can differ significantly from individual to individual depending on age, total health and the concentration and length of exposure.<p>
