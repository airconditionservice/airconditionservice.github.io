The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can check and keep. Leaky return ducts can also present moisture. Once again, if you suspect a mold issue, consider having a service company examine the duct system for leakages.<p>
