<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider since the 2 specialists I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
