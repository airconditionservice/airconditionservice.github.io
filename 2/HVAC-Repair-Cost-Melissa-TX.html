<p>Recent Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician discussed the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>While toxins typically discovered in indoor air are responsible for numerous harmful effects, there is significant uncertainty about what concentrations or periods of direct exposure are required to produce particular illness. Individuals also react extremely in a different way to exposure to indoor air pollutants. Further research is needed to better understand which health effects occur after exposure to the typical pollutant concentrations found in houses and which take place from the greater concentrations that happen for short time periods.<p>
<p>Ventilation plays an important function in indoor air quality. According to the EPA, ventilation is a mix of procedures which results in the supply and elimination of air from inside a building." Those processes consist of bringing in outside air, conditioning it and mixing it with indoor air, dispersing that air throughout the structure, and moving some part of indoor air exterior. If several of these procedures are underperforming, the quality of indoor air will be affected.<p>
