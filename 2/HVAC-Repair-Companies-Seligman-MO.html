<h3>Elements of a High Efficiency Furnace at Seligman MO</h3>
<p>After living in our house for 15 years we figured itâ $ s time to replace the air conditioning. I went ahead and bought this Provider and I must state it gets the job done quite well. It takes really little time to warm up or cool off your home which is one of the things we didnâ $ t obtain from the one we had in the past. The system hasnâ $ t needed any repair work and Iâ $ ve had it for about half a year now.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He took the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and knowledgeable. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
