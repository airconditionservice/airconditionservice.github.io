<p>In a normal residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar earned to his employees, equipment costs, marketing, energies, and other costs before paying himself anything. Normally this leaves about 6% of earnings to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This doesn't sound like much, especially if the objective of owning a company was for monetary flexibility. Plus, this 6% seeks the few years it required to build the business and not taking an earnings as the owner. However, this 6% generally isn't the end goal. HVAC business owners must pursue 10-15% by cutting expenses in some areas or increasing their profits while keeping expenses the same in all other areas.<p>

Additionally, throughout winter season, the heat from underground can be taken in to heat domestic water along with its primary purpose of offering area heating. This suggests that cost savings are still understood during the cooler duration. In fact, a desuperheater minimizes winter season water heating expenses by roughly half.<p>
