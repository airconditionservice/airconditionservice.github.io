<p>My house has 5 systems, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" discovered something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned up for an extra $30.00. (He literally stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I complained and got a refund) When this person belittled me for my "not understanding", I threw him off the residential or commercial property.<p>
