<p>Inspect these three things initially if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Ensure all the signs up in your home are broad open. Then make certain the furnace filter is clean Then go outdoors and clean off the condenser coils (Photo 2). If numerous signs up were closed or the filter was obstructed, the reduced air flow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. Deice the A-coil if you've changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up.

Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've resolved the issue.<p>
