<p>Even if your central air conditioning conditioner is simply 8 to ten years old, it might suck up to twice the electrical energy that even a low-end new one would use. That's since it operates at or below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Performance Ratio, which is the amount of energy needed to provide a specific cooling output. Till 2006, 10 SEER was standard, but these days, the minimum allowed by federal law is 13 SEER. That translates to 30% less electrical intake and 30% lower cooling costs than equipment set up just a couple of years ago.<p>
