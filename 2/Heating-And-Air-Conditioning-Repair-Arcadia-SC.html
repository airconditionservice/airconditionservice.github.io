<p>The directions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfortable finishing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the brand-new circuit breaker and final connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We suggest you do the same. When the electrical wiring is complete, energize the system for a couple of minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable warms. Don't put the system into complete operation until the thin-set and grout have had time to effectively solidify and treat-- normally two to 4 weeks. Then call the household together and play a game of Scrabble on your relaxing, warm bathroom flooring.<p>

Even if bleeding the furnace does work, however you find you need to do it frequently, it's most likely time for an expert viewpoint.<p>
