<p>A specific air conditioning unit that is utilized just for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also utilizes a refrigeration cycle, but differs from a basic ac system in that both the evaporator and the condenser are positioned in the same air path. A standard air conditioner transfers heat out of the space since its condenser coil releases heat outside. However, considering that all parts of the dehumidifier remain in the exact same space, no heat is gotten rid of.
