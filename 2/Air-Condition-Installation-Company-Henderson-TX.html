<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is linked to a remote condenser system using refrigerant piping between an indoor and outdoor  unit rather of ducting air straight from the outdoor system. Indoor systems with directional vents mount onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or fit into the ceiling. Other indoor systems install inside the ceiling cavity, so that brief lengths of duct handle air from the indoor system to vents or diffusers around the rooms.<p>
