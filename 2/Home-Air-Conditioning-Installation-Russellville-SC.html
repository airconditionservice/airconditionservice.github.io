We frequently see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a building as reasonably unchanged physical product with time. In fact, the real nature of buildings can be deemed the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be explained and understood as complicated systems. Research study applying the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can assist increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
