<h3>HVAC Air Conditioning Service in Lakewood CA</h3>
<p>Ducted heat pump cooling and heating systems act much like traditional central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces via a duct system. A ducted heatpump system may be most affordable if your house or structure has an existing duct system that is in good condition. Utilizing existing ductwork will eliminate the requirement to install a pricey new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>It may feel cozy being sealed in tight versus the cold in your house during the chillier months of the year, however for people who are delicate to indoor irritants or have respiratory problems, winter season can worsen problems.

<p>I called Snowflake Air since my furnace was not working. Jose and his assistant showed up on time. Jose hung around troubleshooting the issue, all the while discussing whatever to me. After finding the thermostat was not working correctly. He needed to go get the right replacement. After the installation of the brand-new thermostat, Jose explained the operation and programing to me. I will definitely use Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
