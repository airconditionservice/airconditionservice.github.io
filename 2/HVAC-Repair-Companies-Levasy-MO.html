After checking 33 homes in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the research study found that there was no significant enhancement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy effectiveness. In many cases, determined particle levels actually increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced right away after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
