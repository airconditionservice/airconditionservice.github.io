<h3>Identifying Shoddy HVAC Ductwork at Fishersville VA</h3>
<p>The majority of residential heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy.

The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) suggests that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside makeup air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living areas of residential buildings. The ASHRAE standards for cosmetics air for bathroom and kitchens in houses are much greater. This fresh cosmetics air waters down indoor impurities and helps exhaust them from the house.<p>
