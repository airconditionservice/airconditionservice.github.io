<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our professional cleaning and sanitizing services are classified as an Important Organisation in Los Angeles. Today's heaters are rated 90% effectiveness or much better; it is not unusual for a modern-day furnace to be ranked 94 or 95% effective. Compared to older designs, which might be ranked as low as 80% efficiency, this can mean significant cost savings in yearly heating expenses. Modern 2- and three-stage heating systems increase effectiveness even further by running at lower or higher capability depending upon the heating requirements of the location.<p>
<p>Steam-based systems tend to be older, and were very popular in the first half of the 20th century, especially in commercial structures, apartment and huge homes. Many steam and radiator boiler systems set up more than 50 years ago stay operable, because the absence of moving parts makes them less vulnerable to tear and use. A steam boiler replacement costs in between $4,000 and $30,000, depending upon boiler size.<p>
