<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is regularly in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps end up being ineffective in more severe cold.

Some heat pump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
