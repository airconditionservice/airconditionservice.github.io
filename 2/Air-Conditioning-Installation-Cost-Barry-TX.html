<p>Start by raising the lower sash, and after that determine the height and width of the opening. When going shopping for an air conditioner to ensure it'll fit easily into the window, be sure to have those dimensions on hand.

<p>A third way to choose whether your house may have poor indoor air quality is to look at your way of life and activities. Human activities can be considerable sources of indoor air contamination. Finally, try to find signs of issues with the ventilation in your house. Signs that can indicate your home may not have adequate ventilation consist of moisture condensation on walls or windows, stinky or stuffy air, dirty central heating and air cooling devices, and areas where books, shoes, or other items end up being musty. To identify odors in your house, action outside for a couple of minutes, and after that upon reentering your home, note whether odors are obvious.<p>
<p>Ventilation plays an essential function in indoor air quality. According to the EPA, ventilation is a mix of procedures which results in the supply and elimination of air from inside a building." Those procedures consist of generating outside air, conditioning it and mixing it with indoor air, dispersing that air throughout the building, and moving some part of indoor air outside. If several of these procedures are underperforming, the quality of indoor air will be affected.<p>
