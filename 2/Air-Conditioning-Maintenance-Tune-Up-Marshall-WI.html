<p>You're encouraging the development of mold in damp air if you set it too low. The heat dries the air, preventing mold growth and contamination. Obviously, too-dry air can also aggravate your lungs and sinuses, while excessive indoor humidity can contribute to the development of bacteria and viruses, according to a 2018 research study in the International Journal of Health and Environmental Health. The perfect humidity in a house is around half, according to the American Lung Association.<p>
<p>In addition, employee health symptoms such as colds, headaches, sleepiness, irritation, and irregular breathing may be induced as the outcome of temperature extremes, inappropriate humidity levels, and too little or too much air flow. Office temperature levels should be preserved in between 68 degrees- 75 degrees Fahrenheit and humidity levels between 30%- 60%. In addition, drafts caused by excessive air circulation need to be prevented.<p>
<p>To put this just, Preventative maintenance is IMPORTANT TO maintain the performance and performance of your HVAC system, several studies through DOE and ACCA can confirm this if you're interested. Nevertheless, pick your contractor sensibly, many of the 'reliable' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not immune to improper sales techniques that DO make the most of uninformed property owners. Again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid site with an agenda. While Angie's list is a good base line indication that you MIGHT be dealing with a credible company, you still should do your research (not all contractors with a similar rating are the very same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (A/c contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>

And for extra support, especially for larger air conditioning unit, consider buying a steel assistance bracket and mount it to the outside home wall, directly listed below the windowsill.<p>
