The choice of indoor units has one constraint: their overall power should not exceed the capability of the outside unit. In practice, however, it is extremely common to see a multi-split system with a total capacity of indoor units higher than the outdoor capacity by at least 20%. However, it is incorrect to expect better performance when all indoor systems are turned on at the very same time, because the overall capacity of the entire system is restricted by the capacity of the outside system. Basically, the outside unit will disperse all its power to all operating indoor units in such a way that a few of the spaces may not have a really comfortable temperature level. However, the computation of the overall power is not easy, because it takes into consideration not only the nominal power of the systems, but also the cooling capability, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, etc<p>
