<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may think. Due to the fact that most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, low-cost flexible tube) instead of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to tear and wear and is easily punctured.<p>
