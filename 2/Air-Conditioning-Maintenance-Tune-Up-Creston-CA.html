<p>EER stands for Energy Performance Ratio. The energy effectiveness of central air systems is determined by the variety of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set range of conditions. As pointed out above, a BTU is a traditional system of heat; it is defined as the amount of heat required to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The common set conditions are outside temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temp of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why many people do not utilize this measurement much any longer.<p>
<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to offer your house that ideal temperature throughout the year.

So, be sure to change your AC filters regularly, or get an a/c service plan which normally consists of a filter modification - especially if you are allergy-prone or live in a city with high levels of contamination.<p>
