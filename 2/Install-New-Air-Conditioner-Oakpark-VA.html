<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire living space. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning aid determine the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes result from a combination of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of wetness, Air cleaning takes place. The goal is to supply sufficient modifications to guarantee a healthy environment. There are a number of kinds of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be set up to accomplish this. A common element needed in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side illustration in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) provides guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>
