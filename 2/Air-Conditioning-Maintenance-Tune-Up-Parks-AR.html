<p>All contemporary air conditioning systems, even little window plan systems, are equipped with internal air filters. These are typically of a light-weight gauze-like product, and should be changed or cleaned as conditions warrant. For example, a structure in a high dust environment, or a home with furry family pets, will require to have the filters changed more often than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to wasted energy, reduced equipment life, and higher energy bills; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air circulation. Additionally, extremely dirty or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or even fire.<p>
