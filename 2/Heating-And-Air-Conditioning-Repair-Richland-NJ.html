A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
