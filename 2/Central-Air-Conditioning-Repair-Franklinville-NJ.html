<p>We are OPEN as an "Important Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds astounding, but furnace service technicians frequently find that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be switched on. Try to find a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Examine the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is securely secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be fully depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>Place the solar tank near the traditional water heater. If the heat exchanger is internal to the storage tank, make sure that the glycol loop connections to the heat exchanger and the cold and hot water connections are available. It is most likely that it is supported by the plumbing if the heat exchanger is external to the storage tank. Set up unions at the tank and heat exchanger connections so that the piping will not have to be cut if the tank or heat exchanger ever need to be replaced.<p>
