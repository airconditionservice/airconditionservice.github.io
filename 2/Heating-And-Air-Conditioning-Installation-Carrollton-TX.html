<p>RMI is working to alter that, beginning in California. As a first step, in April RMI affirmed prior to the California Air Resources Board, asking the agency to set more powerful indoor guidelines based upon the most recent science for NO2.

<p>Co2 concentrations increase as a result of human tenancy, however lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and intake of fresh air.
