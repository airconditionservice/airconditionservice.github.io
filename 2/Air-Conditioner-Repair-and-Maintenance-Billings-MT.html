<p>The most typical kind of house heater in the U.S. burns natural gas or gas to produce heat. With an average cost that ranges from $2,500 to $14,000 to install, they are not the least costly alternative, but more recent systems can be really energy effective. According to the Department of Energy, older gas systems typically achieve a 68 to 72 percent AFUE, while newer, highly effective gas heaters can accomplish AFUE rankings as high as 90 to 97 percent.<p>
<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a requirement for air conditioner repair, which you need to look out for. Initially, you need to check your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little unreasonable, however ice on your a/c unit can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively if entirely iced over.<p>
