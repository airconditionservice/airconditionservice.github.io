<p>Recent Review: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and respectful. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
