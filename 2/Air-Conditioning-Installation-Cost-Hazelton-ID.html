<h3>HVAC Installation in Hazelton ID</h3>
<p>I typically don't leave reviews but wished to share my experience. You don't anticipate having to change your AC unit. Regrettably for us, we had no other choice. What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long method. Other companies would set up a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional reviewing my choices. After organisation hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and talk about options. I arranged my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my questions as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a family good friend and now I will recommend this company to my good friends.<p>
<p>G&S did an excellent job installing our new furnace and AC unit. The best aspect of G&S is that they guarantee for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace failed within a couple of months (no fault of G&S). Producers guarantee would cover the parts cost but G&S fixed and covered labor cost under their guarantee. Likewise they detected the problem and fixed extremely rapidly. Definitely A++ installation and service.<p>
