<p>Specific immediate impacts resemble those from colds or other viral diseases, so it is often challenging to figure out if the symptoms are an outcome of direct exposure to indoor air contamination. For this reason, it is important to focus on the time and place the signs occur. If the symptoms fade or go away when an individual is far from the home and return when the individual returns, an effort must be made to recognize indoor air sources that might be possible causes. Some effects might be intensified by an inadequate supply of outside air or from the humidity, heating, or cooling conditions common in the house.<p>
<p>Some health results may appear shortly after a single direct exposure or repeated exposures to a contaminant. These include inflammation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, lightheadedness, and fatigue. Such immediate impacts are treatable and usually short-term. Sometimes the treatment is simply getting rid of the person's direct exposure to the source of the contamination, if it can be determined. Right after direct exposure to some indoor air toxins, symptoms of some illness such as asthma might appear, be intensified or gotten worse.<p>
