<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a requirement for air conditioning system repair, which you need to look out for. First, you must check your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little ridiculous, however ice on your air conditioning system can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
