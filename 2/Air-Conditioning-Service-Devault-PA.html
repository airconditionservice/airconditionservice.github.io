<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, inspect these 3 things initially. Make certain all the signs up in the house are wide open. Then make certain the furnace filter is tidy Then go outdoors and tidy off the condenser coils (Picture 2). The lowered airflow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if numerous registers were closed or the filter was obstructed. Deice the A-coil if you have actually altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or until there's good air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to test it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've solved the issue.<p>
