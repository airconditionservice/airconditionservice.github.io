<p>Have actually used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. When I have problems, they give me concern and a lower rate. Purchased a brand-new main system and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever buy extended warranties or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Good investment in my opinion. Never ever attempt to offer me something I don't need.<p>
