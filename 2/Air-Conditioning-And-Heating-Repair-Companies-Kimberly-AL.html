<p>New air conditioning unit generally range from 13 SEER to 23 SEER. A greater SEER score indicates greater energy effectiveness and potentially lower energy expenses. A great SEER score for you depends on your home size, where you live and other factors. Even the minimally allowed SEER rating is going to be far more energy effective than your existing, old air conditioner. It's not always about selecting the model with the greatest SEER score, it's discovering the one that's right for you. This is where your dealership can help.<p>
<p>There is a needed balance in making your decision though as systems with higher AFUE rankings often feature greater cost. So, ensure to decide based upon how often you will use your heating unit, the load that will be placed on it and the frequency with which you intend on having it serviced each year. For a lot of temperate environments with low heating loads in the winter, having an incredibly high rated heating unit is not always essential.<p>
<p>Many disconnect blocks consist of two cartridge merges. Inspect them before you proceed with repairs (Image 3). A blown fuse signifies a failing part inside the condensing unit.

Call a pro-- you have actually got more major issues if it blows again.<p>
