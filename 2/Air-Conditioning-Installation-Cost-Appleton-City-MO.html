<p>Due to the fact that they eliminate moisture from the air, Air conditioners can develop a lot of water. To get rid of this, they have a typically plastic drain pipeline that comes out of the side of the air handler. In time, algae can obstruct this pipe and, when it does, the AC won't work. In fact, some condensate drains pipes have a float switch that won't let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can likewise puddle around the unit or flood the area.

The heat exchanger had an extremely small bubble on the surface which the tech said 'could' cause a problem in the future.

To put it simply, in-floor heating unit provide a different mode and level of comfort. And, as various public awareness campaigns have long reminded us, the more comfortable we feel, the more inclined we may be to nudge down our thermostat, in turn decreasing our energy expenditures.<p>
