Such details can often be gotten by requesting copies of air monitoring data from the employer.

Review of this information may identify potentially harmful sources of contamination and resultant worker health signs. Nevertheless, when contaminant concentrations are extremely low, monitoring data may not explain the observed or reported health symptoms.<p>
