A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
