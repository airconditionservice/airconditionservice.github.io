<p>The guidelines that included the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfortable completing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the new breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We recommend you do the same. When the electrical wiring is total, stimulate the system for a couple of minutes to ensure the controls work and resistance cable warms. Don't put the system into complete operation up until the thin-set and grout have actually had time to properly treat and solidify-- usually two to four weeks.
