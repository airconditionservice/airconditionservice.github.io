The technician invested a good quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
