<h3>Electric Furnace in Willow Creek MT</h3>
<p>Some air conditioning systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also frequently referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioner". The heatpump is significantly more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, along with the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system also switches functions to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
