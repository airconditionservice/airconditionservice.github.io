<h3>Heating And Cooling Near Me in Westwood NJ</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you may believe. Because the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive flexible hose pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to wear and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>

<p>Recent Review: They were great! Many HVAC companies focus just on upsell and forget to offer you with the service initially asked for.
