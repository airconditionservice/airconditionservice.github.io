<p>It is still possible that an indoor air contamination problem exists if no pollutant sources are discovered. Excessive re-circulation of air causes "stale air" conditions. Stagnant air has higher levels of co2 and carbon monoxide gas (produced from human breathing and cigarette smoke, respectively) than outdoors air. Stale air might likewise be a problem when ventilation is not sufficient to account for a boost in the variety of employees in the area.<p>
<p>Energy efficiency can be enhanced even more in central heating systems by presenting zoned heating. This permits a more granular application of heat, similar to non-central heating unit. Zones are managed by several thermostats. In water heating systems the thermostats manage zone valves, and in forced air systems they manage zone dampers inside the vents which selectively obstruct the circulation of air. In this case, the control system is extremely vital to maintaining a correct temperature level.<p>
<p>It is not recommended that "routine" occupational direct exposure limits (e.g., OELs, TLVs ®, PELs) be utilized to identify if the general indoor air quality satisfies a certain standard. Occupational direct exposure limits noted in health and wellness guidelines and the Limit Limit Worths ® (TLVs) suggested by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) are intended as a guide to avoid illness or specific results (like eye and nose irritation) in industrial circumstances. These limits might not be suitable in office settings or for the house.<p>

<p>Biological impurities include bacteria, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and feline saliva, house dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these pollutants. Pollens stem from plants; infections are transmitted by individuals and animals; germs are brought by individuals, animals, and soil and plant debris; and household animals are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a powerful allergen. When it dries, it can become airborne. Polluted central air handling systems can end up being reproducing premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological impurities and can then distribute these contaminants through the house.<p>
