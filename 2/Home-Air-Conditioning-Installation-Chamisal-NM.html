<p>Current Review: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and courteous. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>

<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as an outcome of human occupancy, however lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the buildup of co2 to quasi "consistent state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. Therefore, measurements of co2 for functions of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after a prolonged period of steady tenancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in workplaces a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable sign of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to measure co2 need to be adjusted regularly, and outdoor measurements used for computations should be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature impacts on measurements made outdoors may also be essential.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: They were great! So many HVAC companies focus simply on upsell and forget to offer you with the service originally asked for.
