<h3>Truth About Castle Hayne NC Homeowners Must Know About Ductwork</h3>
<p>If that business is to flourish, a business plan for an HVAC company can't remain stagnant. You can't just develop your service strategy and after that ignore it. If it's not, you require to know whether that plan is working and what modifications you need to make.

<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the demand to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
