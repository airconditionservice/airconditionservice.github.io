<p>It prevails to assume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, fairly stable gradually. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a building as fairly unchanged physical product over time. In reality, the real nature of buildings can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be explained and understood as complicated systems. Research using the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the constructed environment thinking about the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
