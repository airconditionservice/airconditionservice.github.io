<p>It is common to assume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable with time. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a building as relatively the same physical material with time. In reality, the real nature of buildings can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be explained and understood as complex systems. Research study applying the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the constructed environment considering the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
