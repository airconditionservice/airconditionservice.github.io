<p>So it ended up that everything they did was 100% assessment, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'cars and truck oil modification' type of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had a really small bubble on the surface which the tech said 'could' trigger a problem in the future. So he said I might swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the very same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>Since it has to run longer than a correctly sized unit, an undersize system will not be able to cool spaces down totally on the most popular days and will cost more to operate. An oversize compressor likewise costs more to run due to the fact that it just takes more electrical energy to run a bigger system. And an oversize system doesn't lower humidity effectively. That's due to the fact that it cools the air so rapidly that it turns off prior to it has a possibility to circulate the appropriate volume of air past the coils to extract the needed wetness. The outcome is a room that doesn't seem as cool as the temperature level shows. In truth, the space can feel damp and clammy.<p>
