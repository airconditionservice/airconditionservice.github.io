<h3>The Fundamentals of Central Heating and Air Conditioning at West Chester PA</h3>
<p>Throughout winter season, the ground source heat is taken in by pumping a water-based and anti-freeze option through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid flows around this loop, sending the absorbed heat to a refrigerant through the evaporator, altering it from a liquid to gas. From here it travels through the compressor, increasing the temperature level of the gas as a direct outcome of the compression procedure. From here, the gas transfers to the condenser, which moves the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heating unit.<p>
<p>7 To check it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the detach next to the compressor and the main panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature level below the room temperature level, and then switch it ON. To prevent straining an air conditioning system's compressor, wait a minimum of 5 minutes between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You need to hear the outdoor compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. Look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this) if the fan isn't turning.<p>
