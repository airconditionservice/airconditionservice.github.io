Less than 24 hr after I called him, I was definitely happy to have a heated home again. What's most fantastic was that this all occurred during Thanksgiving week! I wasn't sure we 'd find somebody to help us right before a holiday, but Climate Pro came through for us. I will gladly suggest this company to my friends.<p>
