<p>In addition, radiators heat the air nearest them initially, which is why spaces heated by radiators are susceptible to cold spots", suggesting that the air feels cold in the middle of the space and really hot next to the radiators.

Radiant heat supplies warmth from the floor up throughout the space without any cold spots or stuffiness in the location being heated.<p>

<p>Evaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working throughout times of high humidity, when there is very little dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for residence occupants. Unlike other kinds of air conditioners, evaporative coolers count on the outside air to be channeled through cooler pads that cool the air before it reaches the within a home through its duct system; this cooled outside air should be permitted to push the warmer air within the house out through an exhaust opening such as an open door or window. 36 These coolers cost less and are mechanically simple to keep and understand.<p>
