However, choose your contractor wisely, a lot of the 'reputable' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not immune to inappropriate sales techniques that DO take advantage of uninformed property owners. Again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid website with a program. While Angie's list is a good base line sign that you MIGHT be working with a reputable company, you still must do your homework (not all contractors with a similar score are the very same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (Cooling contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>Indoor contamination sources that release gases or particles into the air are the main cause of indoor air quality issues.

Heat and humidity levels can likewise increase concentrations of some pollutants.<p>
