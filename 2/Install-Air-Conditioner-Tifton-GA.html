<p>Due to the fact that it has to run longer than a correctly sized unit, an undersize system will not be able to cool rooms down totally on the most popular days and will cost more to operate.

The outcome is a room that does not seem as cool as the temperature level shows. In reality, the room can feel wet and clammy.<p>
