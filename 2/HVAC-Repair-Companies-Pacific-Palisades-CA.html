<p>Sean was extremely practical. He is a very enjoyable person to deal with. No pressure applied to buy extra things. Addressed all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put rise protectors on the system and do the complete maintenance on the system. that was to make certain they were no concerns other than the blower motor.

He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he understands for sure what the concern is.<p>

<p>Biological pollutants consist of germs, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and cat saliva, home dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are numerous sources of these toxins. Pollens stem from plants; infections are sent by animals and individuals; germs are brought by people, animals, and soil and plant debris; and family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a powerful irritant. It can become air-borne when it dries. Infected central air handling systems can end up being reproducing premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then distribute these contaminants through the house.<p>
