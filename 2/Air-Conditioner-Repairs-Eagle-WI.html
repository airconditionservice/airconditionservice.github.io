<h3>Understanding the Essentials of Furnace, AC and HVAC Maintenance in Eagle WI</h3>
<p>A hydronic radiant floor heat system works by heating water or glycol in a boiler and pumping it through a labyrinth of pipes set up under the flooring or right within the flooring surface itself. The heat from the hot water transfers to the floor mass and after that radiates through thermal transfer to other posts with strong mass such as the walls, ceilings, furniture and people. It does not depend on heating or moving air to transfer warmth.<p>
<p>Current Review: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and knowledgeable. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
