<p>Radiant heating covers a range of various heating unit, including electric heating units and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heat systems operate on comparable concepts.

EPA studies of human exposure to air contaminants show that indoor levels of toxins may be two to 5 times-- and sometimes more than 100 times-- higher than outdoor levels. The EPA and its Science Board of advisers regularly rank indoor air pollution amongst the leading five environmental health threats to the public.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and respectful. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
