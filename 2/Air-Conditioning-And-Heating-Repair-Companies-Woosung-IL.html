PTACs, which are regularly utilized in hotels, have 2 different units (terminal packages), the evaporative system on the interior and the condensing unit on the outside, with an opening passing through the wall and linking them.

PTAC systems may be adapted to supply heating in winter, either straight by using an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to draw and heat the interior heat from the exterior air, transforming the air conditioner into a heat pump While room air conditioning offers maximum flexibility, when used to cool lots of rooms at a time it is normally more costly than central air.<p>
