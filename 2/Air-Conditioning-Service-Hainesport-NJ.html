<p>SysTech Design specializes in industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for enhancing and keeping the quality of the air in and around a commercial environment.

Condensed wetness can trigger dust and other particles to stick to and build up on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils ensures dirt doesn't develop and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from accumulating on and beneath the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>
