<p>Among the disadvantages of central heating is that it's potentially costly to set up, especially in an older house. Depending upon the type of unit installed, it can be noisy and trigger problems if you're extremely allergic to dust. In addition, certain fuels and equipment might require special authorizations, and there is limited flexibility in case of changed heating requirements. Throughout use, there is a time delay while heat is being carried from the heating unit to the living space.<p>
