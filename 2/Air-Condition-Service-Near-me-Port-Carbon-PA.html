<p>All houses need effective ventilation. The quality of indoor air inside offices, schools, and other work environments is necessary not only for workers' comfort but also for their health. Poor indoor air quality (IAQ) has been tied to signs like headaches, fatigue, difficulty focusing, and inflammation of the eyes, nose, throat and lungs. Also, some specific diseases have been linked to particular air pollutants or indoor environments, like asthma with wet indoor environments. In addition, some direct exposures, such as asbestos and radon, do not cause instant symptoms but can result in cancer after several years.<p>
<p>The impacts of lead direct exposure on fetuses and children can be severe. They consist of delays in physical and mental advancement, lower IQ levels, shortened attention periods, and increased behavioral issues. Children, infants, and fetuses are more vulnerable to lead exposure than adults because lead is more easily absorbed into growing bodies, and the tissues of small children are more sensitive to the harmful results of lead. Children may have greater direct exposures because they are most likely to get lead dust on their hands and after that put their fingers or other lead-contaminated items into their mouths.<p>

For example, wetness management and humidity control needs systems to be set to provide make-up air at lower temperature levels (design levels), instead of the greater temperature levels in some cases used to save energy in cooling-dominated environment conditions. However, for most of the United States and many parts of Europe and Japan, throughout the majority of hours of the year, outdoor air temperature levels are cool enough that the air does not require additional cooling to offer thermal comfort inside your home. Nevertheless, high humidity outdoors produces the need for mindful attention to humidity levels inside.

The efforts in which these procedures are demonstrated in the field has actually led to the development of an important database of structure ventilation and indoor air quality performance.<p>
<p>Co2 concentrations increase as a result of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of carbon dioxide to quasi "steady state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. Therefore, measurements of co2 for functions of assessing the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged period of constant occupancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in workplaces a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to determine co2 need to be calibrated often, and outdoor measurements used for calculations should be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level impacts on measurements made outdoors might likewise be essential.<p>
