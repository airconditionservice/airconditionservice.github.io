<p>EER stands for Energy Efficiency Ratio. The energy effectiveness of central air conditioning units is measured by the number of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set range of conditions. As discussed above, a BTU is a traditional system of heat; it is specified as the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The normal set conditions are outdoor temps of 95 ° F and an indoor temperature of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why the majority of people do not utilize this measurement much anymore.<p>

<p>Biological pollutants include germs, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and feline saliva, house dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these toxins. Pollens stem from plants; viruses are sent by individuals and animals; germs are carried by people, animals, and soil and plant debris; and family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a potent irritant. When it dries, it can end up being air-borne. Polluted central air conditioning handling systems can end up being reproducing premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological contaminants and can then disperse these pollutants through the house.<p>
