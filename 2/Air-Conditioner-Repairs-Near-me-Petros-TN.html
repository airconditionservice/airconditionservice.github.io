<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel frequently receives requests for consultation and assistance in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal firms. During the 1970s, many house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation measure. Nevertheless, a lot of these homes were found to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Couple of houses are now being insulated with this item. Studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was set up several years earlier are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
