<p>To state there are a great deal of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Location the a/c unit back into its initial box, using the dense-foam packaging product to safeguard it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware products in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in the box. Set package in a cool, dry place for the winter. And if the storeroom has a concrete floor, location two 2x4s underneath the box to raise it up and safeguard it from wetness.<p>
<p>Geothermal HVAC systems are becoming typical features of eco-friendly homes as part of the growing green structure motion. Green projects represented 20 percent of all newly constructed homes in the U.S. in 2015.

<p>Excellent Item! Shipment was sort of odd being that the box was opened and items might have fell out. However after review of contents we assured it was all intact. The item was incredibly lite weight and takes some time to use. Keep in mind: purchase advised non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We utilized the Kerdi as advised to the height of the shower head and had to adjust the shower floor and curb to fit. Make certain to enjoy the video first prior to installation and follow all directions precisely. If you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had concerns with air bubble pockets. After getting in touch with support, we dealt with issues. I would recommend this item to anybody who's remodeling or installing their bathroom for the first time. Including a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench quickly.<p>
