We typically see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a building as relatively unchanged physical material with time. In truth, the true nature of structures can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be described and understood as complex systems. Research study applying the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can assist increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the developed environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
