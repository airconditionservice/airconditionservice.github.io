<h3>The Most Frequent Causes of Blocked Ducts at HVAC Systems</h3>
<p>All modern air conditioning systems, even small window package systems, are equipped with internal air filters. These are usually of a lightweight gauze-like material, and should be replaced or cleaned as conditions require. For instance, a structure in a high dust environment, or a house with furry animals, will require to have the filters changed more frequently than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in lost energy, shortened equipment life, and higher energy bills; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air circulation. Furthermore, very dirty or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or even fire.<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't lucrative you would not use them.. Secondly like prolonged automobile guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is truly sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the essential skills to do the task and also the morals to treat customers fairly. As a client you require to be well informed in order not to be entirely taken advantage of. A lot of companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to correctly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Lastly found somebody to properly service and the unit has been operating issue free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
