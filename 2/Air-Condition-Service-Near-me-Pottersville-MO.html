<p>Moisture management and humidity control needs operating HVAC systems as created. Moisture management and humidity control might contravene efforts to attempt to enhance the operation to conserve energy. For example, wetness management and humidity control requires systems to be set to supply cosmetics air at lower temperature levels (design levels), rather of the greater temperature levels often used to save energy in cooling-dominated environment conditions. Nevertheless, for most of the US and lots of parts of Europe and Japan, during most of hours of the year, outside air temperature levels are cool enough that the air does not require additional cooling to supply thermal comfort indoors. Nevertheless, high humidity outdoors develops the requirement for careful attention to humidity levels inside. High humidities generate mold growth and moisture inside is related to a greater prevalence of occupant breathing issues.<p>
