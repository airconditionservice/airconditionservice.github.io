<p>Among the downsides of central heating is that it's potentially costly to install, especially in an older home. Depending upon the type of system installed, it can be loud and cause issues if you're highly allergic to dust. In addition, specific fuels and equipment might need unique permits, and there is limited flexibility in case of changed heating requirements. Throughout use, there is a dead time while heat is being transported from the heating unit to the home.<p>
<p>The possibility of immediate reactions to indoor air contaminants depends on several aspects. Age and preexisting medical conditions are two crucial influences. In other cases, whether an individual reacts to a pollutant depends on specific level of sensitivity, which varies tremendously from person to person. Some people can become sensitized to biological toxins after repeated direct exposures, and it appears that some people can end up being sensitized to chemical pollutants as well.<p>
