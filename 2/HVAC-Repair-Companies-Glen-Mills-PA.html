<p>Learn about PSR Mechanical. The efficiency of an air cleaner depends upon how well it gathers pollutants from indoor air (revealed as a portion performance rate) and just how much air it draws through the cleaning or filtering element (expressed in cubic feet per minute).

The long-lasting performance of any air cleaner depends upon maintaining it according to the maker's instructions.<p>
