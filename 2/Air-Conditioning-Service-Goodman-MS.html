<p>Radiant heating covers a series of various heating unit, consisting of electric heating systems and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heating systems run on similar principles. In the case of a boiler, the system warms by dispersing hot water through a series of pipes installed in the sub-floor of each room.

As the warm water (or electricity) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the floor and into the room.<p>
