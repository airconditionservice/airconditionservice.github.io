<p>Your ventilation, air, and heating conditioning system (HVAC) act as a collection source for a variety of pollutants that have the potential to negatively affect your health-- impurities such as mold, fungis, germs, and extremely small particles of dust. Your heating and cooling contractor must examine and, if needed, upgrade the building envelope. For instance, he may seal gaps and cracks in the outer walls and attic flooring, or he may blow insulation into the walls, either of which could knock as much as 30% off your heating and cooling expenses. Insulation may be a more reliable solution to your cooling problems than changing your equipment.<p>
<p>When filters aren't replaced or cleaned regularly, they can end up being blocked with particles that can restrict airflow, potentially affecting your comfort and your system's performance.
