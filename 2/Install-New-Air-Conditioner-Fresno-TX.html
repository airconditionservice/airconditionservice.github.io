<p>An indoor air pollutant is a substance in the air that may impact the health of individuals who reside in the home. Pollutants might come from outside the home-- such as an idling cars and truck engine in a connected garage, yard trash burning, or radon entering your home from the ground below. An air toxin could also originate from inside the home-- such as carbon monoxide gas from a faulty furnace, volatile organic substances (VOCs) from a freshly painted room, pre-owned smoke, mold growing on moist or damp carpets, or chemicals from pastimes, household cleaning, or individual care items.

<p>Most Midtown Houston Tx consumers don't know why their HVAC unit is not working when they place a 24 hr emergency ac repair request. If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outdoors system we'll be frozen too. Depending on how thick the ice build-up is at your condensing system, then you'll have a good idea of how thick the ice build-up is in the evaporator coil.
