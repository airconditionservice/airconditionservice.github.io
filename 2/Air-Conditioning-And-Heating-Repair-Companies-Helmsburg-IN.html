There are numerous types of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be installed to accomplish this. A common aspect necessary in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies assistance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Design.<p>
