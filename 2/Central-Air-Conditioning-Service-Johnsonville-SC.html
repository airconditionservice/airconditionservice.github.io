When estimating the cost of an installation, a safe cost evaluation bracket is in between $10 to $20 per square foot dependant on the kind of system you select for your house.

<p>A SEER rating means Seasonal Energy Effectiveness Ratio. The SEER score of an unit is the cooling output at varying temperature levels throughout the cooling season divided by the overall electric energy input during the very same period. Basically, SEER offers more information based on how the EER carries out in various temperatures. The higher the unit's SEER ranking, the more energy effective it is. 1 A system's SEER ranking can be discovered on the yellow Energy Guide tag affixed to all devices.<p>

<p>Since they remove moisture from the air, Air conditioners can produce a lot of water. To get rid of this, they have an usually plastic drain pipeline that comes out of the side of the air handler. With time, algae can block this pipeline and, when it does, the AC won't work. In truth, some condensate drains have a float switch that will not let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can also puddle around the system or flood the area. To deal with condensate issues, please see Air conditioning system Leaks Water, listed below.<p>

<p>Carbon monoxide gas (CO) is a colorless, odor-free gas that hinders the delivery of oxygen throughout the body. At high concentrations it can cause unconsciousness and death. Lower concentrations can trigger a variety of symptoms from headaches, d izziness, weakness, confusion, queasiness, and disorientation, to fatigue in healthy individuals and episodes of increased chest pain in individuals with persistent cardiovascular disease. The signs of carbon monoxide gas poisoning are in some cases confused with the influenza or gastrointestinal disorder. Fetuses, babies, elderly individuals, and people with anemia or with a history of heart or respiratory disease can be particularly sensitive to carbon monoxide exposures.<p>
