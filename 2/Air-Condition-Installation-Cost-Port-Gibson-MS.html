<h3>HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) Principles in Port Gibson MS</h3>
<p>Prices for furnace service and maintenance will differ extensively from dealership to dealer, for a number of factors. Some dealerships will be provide a more extensive service with stated performance assurances, while others may do a more fundamental service at a special rate to create new business. Both approaches can yield the desired outcome of keeping your furnace heating system carrying out well as long as the service is provided by a trusted HVAC contractor.

<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the need to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
