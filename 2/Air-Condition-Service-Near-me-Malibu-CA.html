<p>Called WSE for a routine assessment. The tech appeared right on time and was friendly & knowledgeable throughout the see. They advised replacing a couple of parts that were heading out. They weren't low-cost however a fast web search confirmed WSE wasn't pumping up prices, so I gladly had them replaced. Nevertheless, a week later the furnace quit working.
