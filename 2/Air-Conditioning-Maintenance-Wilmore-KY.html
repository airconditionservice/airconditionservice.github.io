Improper adjustment, frequently shown by a relentless yellow-tipped flame, triggers increased contaminant emissions. Ask your gas company to adjust the burner so that the flame tip is blue.

<p>Recent Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company because the two professionals I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
