<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to complete. I 'd priced out brand-new units and installation for months. As soon as I chose to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Lot system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not only was the cost great however Mark headed out of his method to customize a few things in my home to make the general air circulation more enhanced. I think it literally only took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future company associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

<p>Integrity Energy was quick to react when I called Gregg at 9:00 pm when our 2 heaters were not working. They showed up the next day and replaced 2 heating systems and make them work. Bryson and Rob worked from 10:00 am to 8:00 pm on Friday up until the brand-new furnaces can heat your home. Honestly, our home heating system is complicated, Rob and his group fixed the old duct work, changed all the dampers, make the entire system work completely.<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, humid air from your house's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil takes in heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is flowed back into your house. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface area of the evaporator coil as liquid water, dripping into a pan listed below. From the pan, the water flows into a drain tube which is typically routed into a basement floor drain, utility sink, or outdoors.<p>
