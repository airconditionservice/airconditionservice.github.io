<p>You're encouraging the growth of mold in wet air if you set it too low. The heat dries out the air, preventing mold growth and contamination. Obviously, too-dry air can likewise irritate your lungs and sinuses, while too much indoor humidity can contribute to the development of germs and infections, according to a 2018 study in the International Journal of Hygiene and Environmental Health. The ideal humidity in a house is around half, according to the American Lung Association.<p>
<p>Cooling can also be provided by a procedure called free cooling which uses pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heatpump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added due to the fact that the temperature level of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, thus decreasing its efficiency.<p>
