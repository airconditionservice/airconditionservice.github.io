<p>The instructions that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfy completing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the new breaker and final connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrician. We recommend you do the same. As soon as the circuitry is total, energize the system for a few minutes to make certain the controls work and resistance cable heats up. Do not put the system into full operation till the thin-set and grout have had time to properly treat and solidify-- normally 2 to four weeks. Then call the household together and play a game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm bathroom floor.<p>
<p>Only a professional can accurately detect why your furnace isn't beginning. If at any point in the process of bleeding the furnace something seems strange or you lose self-confidence, it's time to call a professional. Similarly, if the process does not work, something else is incorrect and you need a technician to analyze the furnace. Even if bleeding the furnace does work, but you find you need to do it often, it's probably time for an expert viewpoint.<p>
