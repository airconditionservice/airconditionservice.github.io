<p>Chemical toxins: Volatile natural substances ( VOCs) are organic chemicals. VOCs are many, varied, and ubiquitous. They consist of both human-made and naturally occurring chemical compounds. Chemical toxins can consist of tobacco smoke, emissions from products used in the structure (e.g., office equipment; furniture, floor and wall coverings e.g. formaldehyde; and cleaning and customer products) accidental spill of chemicals, and gases such as carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide, which are products of combustion.<p>
<p>EER stands for Energy Performance Ratio. The energy performance of central air conditioning systems is determined by the variety of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set range of conditions. As mentioned above, a BTU is a standard unit of heat; it is specified as the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The normal set conditions are outside temps of 95 ° F and an indoor temp of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why most people do not utilize this measurement much anymore.<p>
<p>Keep in mind, too, that you may wish to speak to a Seattle HVAC contractor, as various heat pump systems can have different heating and cooling capabilities. If you currently have a home heating system, you might search for a heatpump more tailored toward cooling capacity and effectiveness. For a higher-end model to take care of your heating and cooling requirements, you'll naturally wish to try to find a model that will have sufficient heating for the cold Seattle winters. Fortunately is that the one major disadvantage of heatpump is that they can fail in the cold or incredibly hot temperatures, which are nonexistent in the Puget Sound location.<p>
<p>Depending upon where in the US your home lies, the local region's environment can change considerably. A home located in the South would require an AC unit with a size capable of cooling your home due to high temperature Summers. A home in the Northern part of the United States would require a much larger heating capability as well which will impact expenses. See the chart below for the average central air conditioner replacement costs by LOTS.<p>
