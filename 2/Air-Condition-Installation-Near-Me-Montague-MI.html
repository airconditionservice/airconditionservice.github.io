<p>Indoor temperature levels are in some cases more difficult to control than they seem due to factors such as heat gains from sunshine, outside conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE suggests temperature levels ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summertime; indoor relative humidity should be preserved at or listed below 65%. The EPA recommends humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to minimize mold development.<p>
<p>It prevails to assume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable gradually. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a structure as reasonably the same physical material over time. In reality, the real nature of buildings can be viewed as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be explained and understood as intricate systems. Research study applying the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the built environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
