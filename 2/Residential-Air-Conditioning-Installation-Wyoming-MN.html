<p>It is common to assume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady in time. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a structure as reasonably the same physical product over time. In truth, the true nature of buildings can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and comprehended as intricate systems. Research using the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
