<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & Air Conditioning company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Sound since 1978. The selection of indoor units has one constraint: their total power needs to not exceed the capability of the outdoor system. In practice, however, it is extremely typical to see a multi-split system with an overall capacity of indoor units greater than the outside capability by a minimum of 20%. Nevertheless, it is wrong to anticipate much better efficiency when all indoor units are turned on at the very same time, considering that the overall capability of the whole system is restricted by the capacity of the outdoor unit. Put simply, the outside system will distribute all its power to all operating indoor systems in such a method that some of the rooms may not have a really comfortable temperature level. Nevertheless, the calculation of the overall power is not simple, since it takes into consideration not just the small power of the systems, however also the cooling capability, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>
<p>The life expectancy of a central air unit is thought about to be 15-20 years, and today's air conditioners are more energy effective than models made even 5 years ago, so it makes monetary sense to replace or upgrade your unit if it's 5 years of ages or older. The best central air conditioner you can purchase today will use 30-50% less energy than one bought in 1975 while providing the same quantity of cooling.<p>
