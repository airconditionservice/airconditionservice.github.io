<p>Recent Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the 2 specialists I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
