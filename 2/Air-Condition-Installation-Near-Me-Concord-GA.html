According to the EPA, nevertheless, the levels of indoor air contaminants are frequently 2 to 5 times higher than outside levels, and in some cases these levels can exceed 100 times that of outdoor levels of the very same pollutants.

<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that uses low-voltage power from the thermostat to change 220-volt high-amperage current to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can wear out and are at the top of the list of typical cooling service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to change it every five years approximately.

Thus, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are utilized to distribute cool air from the cooling system.
