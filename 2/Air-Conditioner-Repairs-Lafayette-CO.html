<p>There are some varieties of mold that contain toxic compounds (mycotoxins). However, exposure to harmful levels of mycotoxin by means of inhalation is not possible in many cases, as toxic substances are produced by the fungal body and are not at considerable levels in the released spores. The main danger of mold development, as it connects to indoor air quality, originates from the allergenic residential or commercial properties of the spore cell wall. More serious than the majority of allergenic properties is the capability of mold to set off episodes face to faces that already have asthma, a severe respiratory illness.<p>

Specialists advise using filters with a MERV 6-8, however higher MERV levels trap smaller sized particles and generally are better for those with allergies or where the indoor environment has a high concentration of mold spores, dust particles, or other irritants.<p>
