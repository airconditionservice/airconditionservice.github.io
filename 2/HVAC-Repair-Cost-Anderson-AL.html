<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odorless gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the throat, eye, and nose and triggers shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the risk of breathing infection; there is also proof from animal studies that duplicated exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the advancement of lung illness such as emphysema. People at specific threat from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide consist of kids and individuals with asthma and other respiratory diseases.<p>
<p>While pollutants commonly discovered in indoor air are accountable for many damaging impacts, there is substantial uncertainty about what concentrations or periods of direct exposure are necessary to produce particular health problems. People also respond extremely in a different way to exposure to indoor air pollutants. Additional research study is needed to much better understand which health results occur after exposure to the average toxin concentrations found in homes and which occur from the greater concentrations that happen for brief time periods.<p>
