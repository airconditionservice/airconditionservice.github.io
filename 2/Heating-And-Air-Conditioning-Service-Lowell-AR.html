<p>The thermostat is the "heart" of your radiant heat system, managing the power to the heating wires and likewise controling the temperature level of the floor. All wiring for your radiant heat system either goes to it or from it. The majority of people will install their thermostat near the entrance of the space they are heating, near the light switches. However, anywhere you install it is fine as long as the area is dry and unblocked.<p>
<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems utilize capacitors to start the compressor. The capacitor shops energy, like a battery does, to have power available to the compressor when the thermostat informs it to switch on. Gradually, capacitors can wear, and when they do, you'll discover the motor running hotter. Before that happens, you want to get those capacitors altered to prevent more damage to your system.<p>
