Usually this leaves about 6% of profits to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This doesn't sound like much, specifically if the objective of owning a service was for financial freedom. Plus, this 6% seeks the couple of years it took to develop business and not taking an income as the owner. However, this 6% usually isn't completion goal. HVAC entrepreneur must strive for 10-15% by cutting expenses in some locations or increasing their earnings while keeping costs the very same in all other areas.<p>
