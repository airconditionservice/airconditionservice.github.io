<p>I'll start with a gas furnace since it's the most typical heating unit in Seattle homes.

If your home already has ducts, replacing your heating system with a brand-new, effective gas furnace is a fairly straightforward procedure. If you are including on to your home or retrofitting a home without ducting, installing a brand-new gas furnace system can be rather costly.<p>
