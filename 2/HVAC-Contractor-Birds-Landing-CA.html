<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't successful you would not use them.. Secondly like prolonged vehicle guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is really sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the essential skills to do the task and also the morals to treat customers relatively. As a consumer you need to be well informed in order not to be completely benefited from. Most companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Finally found someone to appropriately service and the system has been running problem free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
