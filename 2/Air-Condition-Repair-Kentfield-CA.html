<p>A ducted heat pump looks like a large central air conditioner unit that sits outdoors your house. Heatpump operate on electrical power and work like air conditioning system in reverse, using a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outdoor air.

In this case, the control system is really important to keeping a proper temperature level.<p>
<p>When your HVAC expert informs you to alter your filters regularly, they're not kidding. It's as crucial as a routine oil modification in your vehicle. A filthy filter requires the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and ultimately shorten its life through wear and tear.

During high usage months, inspect the filters at least monthly.<p>

<p>Normally the most efficient way to improve indoor air quality is to remove individual sources of pollution or to reduce their emissions. Some sources, like those which contain asbestos, can be sealed or confined; others, like gas ranges, can be gotten used to decrease the quantity of emissions. Oftentimes, source control is also a more cost-effective method to securing indoor air quality than increasing ventilation since increasing ventilation can increase energy costs. Specific sources of indoor air contamination in your home are listed later in this area.<p>
<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is frequently in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps become ineffective in more severe cold. This is since ice types on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system must temporarily switch back into the regular air conditioning mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered just in this mode in order to make up for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
