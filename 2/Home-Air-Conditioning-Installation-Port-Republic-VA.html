<p>Ducted heatpump heating & cooling systems act just like standard central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas by means of a duct system.

Using existing ductwork will remove the need to set up a costly brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
