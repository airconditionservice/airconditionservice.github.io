<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier because the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts.
