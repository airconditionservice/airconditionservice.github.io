For example, a heat exchanger might fail prematurely due to the fact that the gas pressure was operating to high, preparing the metal and triggering premature degeneration, leading to fractures and holes. If that client had actually received a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure stays in line and safeguards the element.  a really helpful result and one that was no charge at the time of service, but one that potentially conserved a customer thousands.<p>
