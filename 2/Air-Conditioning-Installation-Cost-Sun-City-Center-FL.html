<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to finish. I 'd priced out brand-new systems and installation for months. Once I decided to final progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Heap unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not only was the price terrific but Mark headed out of his way to personalize a few things in my house to make the general air flow more enhanced.
