<p>The guidelines that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfortable finishing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the new breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrician. We suggest you do the same. As soon as the circuitry is total, energize the system for a few minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable television heats up. Do not put the system into full operation till the thin-set and grout have had time to correctly treat and solidify-- typically two to 4 weeks. Then call the family together and play a game of Scrabble on your relaxing, warm restroom floor.<p>
