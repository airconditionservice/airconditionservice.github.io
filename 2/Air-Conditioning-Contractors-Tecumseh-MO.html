<h3>The Basics of Central Heating and Air Conditioning in Tecumseh MO</h3>
<p>Formaldehyde, a colorless, pungent-smelling gas, can cause watery eyes, burning experiences in the eyes and throat, nausea, and problem in breathing in some human beings exposed at elevated levels (above 0.1 parts per million). High concentrations may trigger attacks in individuals with asthma. There is proof that some people can establish a sensitivity to formaldehyde. It has actually likewise been shown to trigger cancer in animals and may trigger cancer in people.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the demand to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly performed in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
