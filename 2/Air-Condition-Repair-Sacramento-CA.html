<h3>What to Look for in an AC Heating Repair Service in Sacramento CA</h3>
<p>We discovered Jake and Adam to be wonderful, and were very delighted that somebody as experienced as Adam was able to repair the air and return conditioner. We had acquired the club member maintenance plan, which helped balance out the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our pointer to any homebuyers: work with Blue Flame to test the a/c before you purchase. We bought this home in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, but Adam stated he had ways to check AC units even in winter. We wish we had actually known him then.<p>
