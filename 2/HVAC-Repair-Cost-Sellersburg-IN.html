HVAC experts recommend following this basic rule when deciding whether it's worth investing in a repair: If the unit is more than 6 years of ages, and the repair will cost more than half the price of a brand-new system, it's finest to buy brand-new. At the 15-year mark, it may be worth changing even if it's still working-- the system will not have a lot more years left in it, and it's likely to be using more energy than needed.<p>
