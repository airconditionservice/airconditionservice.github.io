<p>Chemical contaminants: Unpredictable natural substances ( VOCs) are natural chemicals. VOCs are many, differed, and ubiquitous. They include both human-made and naturally occurring chemical substances. Chemical pollutants can include tobacco smoke, emissions from products used in the building (e.g., office devices; flooring, furniture and wall coverings e.g. formaldehyde; and cleaning and consumer products) unexpected spill of chemicals, and gases such as carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide, which are products of combustion.<p>
<p>Co2 concentrations increase as a result of human occupancy, however lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of carbon dioxide to quasi "consistent state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. For that reason, measurements of co2 for purposes of assessing the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged duration of consistent occupancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in workplaces a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable sign of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to measure carbon dioxide should be calibrated frequently, and outside measurements used for estimations need to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level impacts on measurements made outdoors might also be essential.<p>
