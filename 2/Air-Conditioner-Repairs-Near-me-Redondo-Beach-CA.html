<p>If you think a mold problem-- either since of noticeable growth or a moldy smell regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it does not eliminate the mold. Mold begins with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can maintain and check. Leaky return ducts can likewise present wetness. Once again, if you presume a mold issue, think about having a service company examine the duct system for leakages.<p>
