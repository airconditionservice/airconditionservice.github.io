Do not put the system into full operation up until the thin-set and grout have actually had time to properly harden and treat-- usually two to 4 weeks. Then call the family together and play a video game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm restroom flooring.<p>

Generally, an HVAC system costs $4,820 to $9,350 to install a 5-ton unit for a 2,000- to 3,000-square-foot home.<p>
