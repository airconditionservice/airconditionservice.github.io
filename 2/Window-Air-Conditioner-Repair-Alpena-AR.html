<p>One of the drawbacks of central heating is that it's potentially costly to install, specifically in an older home. Depending upon the kind of system installed, it can be noisy and trigger problems if you're highly adverse dust. Additionally, particular fuels and devices might need special permits, and there is limited versatility in case of changed heating requirements. During use, there is a time delay while heat is being transferred from the heating system to the home.<p>
<p>G&S did an outstanding job installing our new furnace and AC unit. The very best feature of G&S is that they guarantee for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace stopped working within a couple of months (no fault of G&S). Producers guarantee would cover the parts cost but G&S fixed and covered labor cost under their guarantee. Also they detected the issue and fixed very rapidly. Absolutely A++ installation and service.<p>
