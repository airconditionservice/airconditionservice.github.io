<p>SysTech Style concentrates on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for enhancing and keeping the quality of the air in and around an industrial environment. The very same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air before it circulates through your house. Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to stay with and build up on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils guarantees dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from accumulating on and beneath the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>
