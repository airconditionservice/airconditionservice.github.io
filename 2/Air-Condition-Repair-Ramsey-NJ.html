<p>There are numerous things to take into consideration when trying to figure out how frequently I should change my a/c filters. Every Houston Heights 77007 77008 house has a distinct DNA on how it builds up dust and dirt. It takes about 6 months of close observation to see how typically your cooling filter gathers dirt and dust. After that, you can make a much better best choice on how often your HVAC filters require changing. Some Houston Midtown 77003 77004 homes have more than one HVAC filter, like townhouses. The more air filters you have in your Houston Galleria 77055 77056 77057 home, the less typically you'll need to clean them. Houston Montrose 77006 77098 homes with just one cooling filter require changing more frequently.<p>

The heat exchanger had a very small bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'could' cause a problem in the future. So he said I could swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the exact same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>The bottom line is to protect your financial investment by just utilizing the services of a licensed contractor or a licensed agent from a business or retailer to do the installation. If you select to attempt to do it yourself, or work with a non-licensed person to do the work, in the majority of, if not all cases, you will void the guarantee for the a/c system. A voided guarantee will not do you any great need to the system stop working or breakdown. Do it right from the outset and employ a certified individual with the experience to set up the system.<p>
