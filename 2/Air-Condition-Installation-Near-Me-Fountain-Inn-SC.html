<p>Information provided in this safety guide is based upon existing scientific and technical understanding of the issues provided and is reflective of the jurisdictional limits established by the statutes governing the co-authoring firms. Structures continuously develop as a result of the modifications in the environment around them in addition to the occupants, materials, and activities within them. The numerous surface areas and the air inside a structure are continuously interacting, and this interaction leads to modifications in each. For instance, we might see a window as altering slightly gradually as it becomes unclean, then is cleaned, accumulates dirt again, is cleaned up once again, and so on through its life. In truth, the dirt" we see might be progressing as an outcome of the interactions among the moisture, chemicals, and biological materials discovered there.<p>
<p>The first a/c and refrigerators employed toxic or combustible gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or lp, that could lead to deadly accidents when they leaked. Thomas Midgley, Jr. developed the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number indicating the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The blend most used in direct-expansion home and building comfort cooling is an HCFC referred to as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>

Co2 at levels that are unusually high inside might cause residents to grow drowsy, to get headaches, or to function at lower activity levels. Outside CO2 levels are usually 350-450 ppm whereas the maximum indoor CO2 level considered appropriate is 1000 ppm. 28 Humans are the primary indoor source of carbon dioxide in many structures. Indoor CO2 levels are an indication of the adequacy of outside air ventilation relative to indoor resident density and metabolic activity.<p>

These procedures range from advanced tracer gas approaches utilized predominantly in building research efforts to less involved treatments that can be employed by building operators.
