<p>G&S did an exceptional task installing our brand-new furnace and AC unit. The best thing about G&S is that they service warranty for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace stopped working within a couple of months (no fault of G&S). Makers guarantee would cover the parts cost but G&S fixed and covered labor cost under their service warranty. Also they detected the problem and fixed extremely rapidly. Definitely A++ installation and service.<p>
<p>Current Review: They were great! So many HVAC companies focus just on upsell and forget to provide you with the service originally asked for. They satisfied my needs completely by providing an expert quote with choices, without pushing extra items. The team showed up on time, kept me informed as they worked, and completed a little early. The also without delay followed up with the required assessments from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I extremely advise this company.<p>
