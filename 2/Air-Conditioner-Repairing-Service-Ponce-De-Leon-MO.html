<p>Recent Review: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He made the effort to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was polite and experienced. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
