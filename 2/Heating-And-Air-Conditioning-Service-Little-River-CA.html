<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company since the 2 technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
