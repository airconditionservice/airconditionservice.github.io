<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is permitted to evaporate, for this reason the heat exchanger is often called an evaporating coil or evaporator.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is frequently in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps end up being ineffective in more severe cold. This is due to the fact that ice kinds on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system need to temporarily switch back into the routine air conditioning mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered just in this mode in order to make up for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
