<h2>How To Hire Certified HVAC Service in Crozet</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>How climate modification impacts air quality and exposure to air pollutants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature (which is a standard modus operandi for contemporary a/c unit) requires that the rate of energy removal by the a/c unit boost. This boost has the impact that, for each unit of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioning unit removes that energy. 39 To do so, the ac system must increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "performance" (coefficient of performance) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is triggered, and the a/c has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioning unit's power intake will increase by 50 W to make up for this, hence making the 100 W heating component cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
