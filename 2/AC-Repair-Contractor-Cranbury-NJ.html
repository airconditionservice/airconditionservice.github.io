In extremely dry climates, evaporative coolers, often referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness throughout heat. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outdoors air through a wet pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the inbound air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is decreased. The temperature of the incoming air is decreased, but it is likewise more damp, so the overall heat (practical heat plus latent heat) is the same. Some of the practical heat of the getting in air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The outcomes can be rather substantial if the going into air is dry enough.<p>
<p>The factor for keeping the heat source low is easy. Heat increases, so it makes good sense to locate the heat source at the flooring level.

Gone is that rush of hot air when the furnace begins and that sudden shot of coolness when it shuts down.<p>
