<p>Heating is the largest energy expenditure in the average house. In very dry climates, evaporative coolers, sometimes referred to as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during heat. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a wet pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The reasonable heat of the incoming air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is lowered. The temperature level of the inbound air is minimized, but it is also more damp, so the total heat (practical heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. Some of the sensible heat of the getting in air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. If the going into air is dry enough, the outcomes can be quite considerable.<p>
