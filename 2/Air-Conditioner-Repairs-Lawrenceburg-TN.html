<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your car's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by distributing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant flows. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator fails, the excess heat produced by the engine might damage the engine elements. To avoid this from happening, have your radiator serviced regularly. To have your radiator needs dealt with by experts, visit Acme Auto Electric & Repair today.<p>
