<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
