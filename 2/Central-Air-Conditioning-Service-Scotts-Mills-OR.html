<p>Co2 concentrations increase as an outcome of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the buildup of co2 to quasi "stable state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. For that reason, measurements of co2 for purposes of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged duration of constant occupancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in workplaces at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable indication of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to determine co2 need to be calibrated frequently, and outside measurements used for estimations ought to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level effects on measurements made outdoors may likewise be needed.<p>
