Was able to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put surge protectors on the unit and do the full maintenance on the system. that was to make certain they were no problems aside from the blower motor. The only reason he might not set up the new blower motor was since there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he understands for sure what the concern is.<p>
