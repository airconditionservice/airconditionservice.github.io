<p>How climate change affects air quality and direct exposure to air pollutants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being preserved at a set temperature (which is a standard modus operandi for contemporary a/c unit) requires that the rate of energy removal by the a/c unit increase.

As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is activated, and the air conditioning system has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioner's power consumption will increase by 50 W to make up for this, hence making the 100 W heating aspect cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
