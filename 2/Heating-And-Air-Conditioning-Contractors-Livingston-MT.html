<p>Under-timber piping is where hydronic piping is set within a wood floor joist system, below the wooded subsurface and final flooring finish. This is typically used in a second or third-floor  location and makes the most of the floor joist cavities while avoiding the cost, weight and additional density of an in-screed concrete put. To make an under-timber radiant flooring heat hydronic system effective, the joist areas are insulated with fiberglass batts, and foil reflectors are set up under the pipes to direct heat up.<p>
