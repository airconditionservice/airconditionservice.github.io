<p>We tend to consider air contamination as something outdoors - haze, smog, or ozone hanging in the air, especially in summer season. These convection heaters are still extensively utilized and are typically called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or gas, but some are electrically powered as well.<p>

<h3>Central Heating Installation Service in Pomona MO</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Loan and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a federal government company, carried out a research study in the 1990s to examine 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it minimizes energy expenses by improving air flow. After evaluating 33 homes in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the research study found that there was no substantial enhancement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy efficiency. In many cases, determined particle levels actually increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced right away after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
