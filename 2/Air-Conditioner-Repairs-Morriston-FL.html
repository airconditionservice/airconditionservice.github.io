The calculation is reasonably easy to perform and will expose what size system you require. If the one you're thinking about wants to determine the best system for your house entirely on experience, move on to another contractor. Though strongly affected by where you live, numerous aspects affect the size system required, including the quantity of wall and attic insulation you have; the types and positioning of doors and windows; and the orientation of your house to the sun.

Make sure to have those dimensions on hand when shopping for an air conditioning system to guarantee it'll fit conveniently into the window.
