<p>When the heat pump went out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was extremely useful in collecting information on the phone and providing clear directions about how to temporarily cope with the issue and prepare the heatpump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was remarkably effective and used clear interaction about the problem, its treatments, and its future prevention. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was professional and friendly. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will absolutely use Stability Energy Systems again, for workplace and home.<p>
<p>Weatherization usually does not cause indoor air issues by adding new contaminants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases discharge toxins.) Nevertheless, procedures such as installing storm windows, weather condition stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can decrease the amount of outdoor air infiltrating into a house. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Strained Systems Overheat - When your system is filthy, and filters are plugged, and possibly refrigerant is low, it will not be operating at optimum effectiveness and could get too hot.
