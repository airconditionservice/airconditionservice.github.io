<p>Your full-service HVAC Repair and Installation Company. Even with regular preventive maintenance, however, there will constantly be the odd issue that occasionally turns up. It is really important that you call G & S Heating Cooling & Electric as soon as possible when you do observe your furnace behaving strangely. The faster you react to problems with your furnace, the much easier they are to repair. Waiting to require repairs will only make the problem even worse, and typically more costly.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding job locating the outdoor unit as close to your house as possible per my request. The task took two days and my yard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was very educated of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed up until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>As kept in mind, improper temperature and humidity levels, and too much or too little air circulation might also add to employee health grievances. Temperature level levels must vary from 68 degrees - 75 degrees Fahrenheit and humidity levels between 30% and 60%. In addition, drafts caused by too much air blood circulation should be avoided. Maintenance of correct temperatures and humidity levels and correct air flow will help to reduce the occurrence of upper respiratory signs, and, perhaps, skin rashes.<p>
<p>When the heatpump headed out in our offices, Taylor at Stability was very practical in gathering info on the phone and supplying clear directions about how to briefly deal with the issue and prepare the heatpump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was incredibly effective and used clear communication about the issue, its treatments, and its future avoidance. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd prepared for, and the service was friendly and expert. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will definitely use Integrity Energy Systems once again, for office and house.<p>
