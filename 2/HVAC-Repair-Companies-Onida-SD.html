<p>The primary problem when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external system to the internal ones.

The very first designs of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not permit you to set the air conditioning separately for each space. However, now the marketplace has a large selection of multi-split systems, in which the practical attributes of indoor units operate separately from each other.<p>
