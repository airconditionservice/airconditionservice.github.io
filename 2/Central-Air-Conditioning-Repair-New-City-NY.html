<p>It prevails to assume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, relatively stable over time. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a structure as reasonably the same physical material gradually. In truth, the real nature of structures can be considered as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be explained and comprehended as complex systems. Research study using the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the developed environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
