<p>If you set it too low, you're encouraging the development of mold in wet air. The heat dries out the air, preventing mold growth and pollution. Naturally, too-dry air can also irritate your lungs and sinuses, while excessive indoor humidity can contribute to the development of bacteria and infections, according to a 2018 study in the International Journal of Hygiene and Environmental Health. The ideal humidity in a home is around 50 percent, according to the American Lung Association.<p>
<p>Heat pumps are a dream come true for folks in Seattle. Cooling is something that most Seattleites will only utilize sparingly, but since heat pumps can supply both heating and cooling through a single system of ductwork, you'll have the best of both worlds!
