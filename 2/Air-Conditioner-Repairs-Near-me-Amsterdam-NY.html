<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff often receives ask for consultation and support in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal companies. During the 1970s, lots of homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation measure. However, a lot of these homes were found to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Couple of houses are now being insulated with this product. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was set up several years back are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
