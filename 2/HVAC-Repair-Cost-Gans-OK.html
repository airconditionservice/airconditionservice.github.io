<h3>Why Choose a Natural Gas Furnace at Gans OK?</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was great and on time. Josh was extremely clear and fast about his examination, ensuring I comprehended what was watched out. My only negative is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go purchase a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So perhaps a little steep on price for this service, but the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance contract is not worth the paper it is composed on. Every technician will tell you clean up the filters, take a hose pipe two times a year and clear out the compressor cabinet. Do not obstruct the vents. Vacuum the signs up at least one a year. Vacuum the intake vent in your home. Now the "tough part" once a year shut down the electricity open the furnace and extremely thoroughly vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, don't touch the elements, close up the cabinet returned on the electrical power. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
