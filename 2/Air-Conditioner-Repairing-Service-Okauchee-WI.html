<p>To state there are a great deal of variables in setting up solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the a/c unit back into its initial box, utilizing the dense-foam packing product to protect it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware products in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in the box. Set the box in a cool, dry location for the winter season. And if the storeroom has a concrete flooring, place 2 2x4s underneath the box to raise it up and protect it from moisture.<p>

They can be linked to your existing ductwork, if you are changing a gas or oil furnace.<p>

<p>While these steps will help to keep your AC system in leading shape, understand that there are maintenance items that only an experienced HVAC technician will have the ability to do.

Likewise, tidy ducts and appropriate air flow are vital to a well-functioning system, however house owners do not have the required devices for the job. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a savvy property owner, it's still essential to have a specialist technician check the system periodically.<p>
<p>The primary reason property owners do not purchase an HVAC service agreement is the cost. They can cost in between $150 and $500 per year, depending on the quantity of services used. If the system is new and still under a manufacturer's guarantee, the cost might not be beneficial. Any significant repairs ought to be covered under the maker's guarantee. Nevertheless, some manufacturers require regular maintenance as a term of the warranty.<p>
<p>Due to the fact that my furnace was not working, I called Snowflake Air. Jose and his assistant showed up on time. Jose spent time repairing the problem, all the while explaining everything to me. After discovering the thermostat was not working properly. He needed to go get the right replacement. After the installation of the new thermostat, Jose described the operation and programing to me. I will definitely use Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
