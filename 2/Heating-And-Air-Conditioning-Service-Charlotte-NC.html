<h3>Boiler Maintenance in Charlotte NC</h3>
<p>If you believe a mold problem-- either since of visible growth or a moldy odor consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it doesn't get rid of the mold. Mold begins with a wetness problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can inspect and maintain. Leaky return ducts can also present moisture. Again, if you think a mold issue, think about having a service company inspect the duct system for leaks.<p>
<p>I have had the pleasure of dealing with Pro-Staff Mechanical, Inc. for practically 10 years and throughout that time, they have actually always offered excellent service. Every person I have handled is friendly and expert. The techs are timely, effective and polite.
