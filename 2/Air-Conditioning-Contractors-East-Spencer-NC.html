<p>In a common residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar made to his staff members, devices expenses, marketing, energies, and other expenditures before paying himself anything. Normally this leaves about 6% of revenues to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This does not seem like much, particularly if the goal of owning a company was for financial flexibility. Plus, this 6% is after the couple of years it took to build business and not taking an earnings as the owner. However, this 6% normally isn't completion objective. HVAC business owners should strive for 10-15% by cutting costs in some locations or increasing their revenues while keeping costs the same in all other areas.<p>

<p>The primary health impact connected with direct exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels may pose threats, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air consisting of radon. Major health organizations (like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number could vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. If you smoke and your home has high radon levels, your threat of lung cancer is particularly high.<p>
