<p>The reason for keeping the heat source low is easy. Heat increases, so it makes sense to locate the heat source at the flooring level. This lets the heat naturally travel through the hot" zone, which is from an individual's toe to head location. All objects in the hot zone reach stability in temperature after the convected heat system has been running for a while, including people. Gone is that rush of hot air when the furnace starts and that abrupt shot of coolness when it shuts off.<p>

<p>Additionally, clean and even vacuum repeatedly in the location where your heating unit is positioned. Although you may think that emptying the space of all items that may ignite at some point provides sufficient safety, in some cases other junk such as lint and dust may collect inside the furnace which might trigger a fire. Too much lint and dust will also clog your filter earlier than it need to be which will be a blow to your budget as you will have to replace the equipment or repair.<p>
<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems utilize capacitors to begin the compressor. The capacitor stores energy, like a battery does, to have power offered to the compressor when the thermostat informs it to turn on. In time, capacitors can wear out, and when they do, you'll observe the motor running hotter. Before that occurs, you want to get those capacitors changed to avoid additional damage to your system.<p>
<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Found both inside and outside, particulate matter is a mixture of liquid beads and solid particles suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, smoke, and pollen. The particles themselves are different sizes, but the ones to be most concerned about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller-- because they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, generated by building and construction, for example, or the burning of fossil fuels, enters into buildings by means of mechanical and natural ventilation. Indoors it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Advanced designs of new houses are starting to feature mechanical systems that bring outside air into the home. Some of these designs include energy-efficient heat recovery ventilators (likewise known as air-to-air heat exchangers). For more information about air-to-air heat exchangers, contact the Conservation and Renewable Energy Questions and Referral Service (CAREIRS), PO Box 3048, Merrifield, VA 22116; (800) 523-2929.<p>
