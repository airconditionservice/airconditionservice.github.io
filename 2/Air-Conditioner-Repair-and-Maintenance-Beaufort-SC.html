<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â The majority of heaters have multiple control boards. The biggest, or only one in some heating systems, is often called the Motherboard. The circuit boards control and collaborate the operation of the motors, sensing units, ignitor, gas valve and more. DIY repair is possible, however the new control board must be installed exactly right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work. Plus, if the issue isnâ $ t effectively detected, changing a board wonâ $ t repair it, and boards are not returnable once installed. Itâ $ s a good idea to leave this repair to a professional to diagnose.<p>
