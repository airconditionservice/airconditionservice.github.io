<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) describes air quality in indoor office, classroom or laboratory environments, as opposed to commercial or outdoor settings.

It may likewise consist of the installation of signs up where the ductwork connects to private spaces.<p>
<p>The reason for keeping the heat source low is basic. Heat rises, so it makes good sense to locate the heat source at the floor level.
