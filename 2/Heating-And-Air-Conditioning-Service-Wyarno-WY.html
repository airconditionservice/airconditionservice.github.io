<p>RMI is working to change that, starting in California. As a primary step, in April RMI testified before the California Air Resources Board, asking the company to set stronger indoor guidelines based on the most current science for NO2. The state of California has the authority to control indoor appliances through codes, and after more powerful standards are set there is a chance to work on enforcement.<p>
<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as an outcome of human tenancy, however lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the buildup of co2 to quasi "steady state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. Therefore, measurements of co2 for functions of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended period of constant tenancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in workplaces at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to measure co2 ought to be calibrated often, and outdoor measurements used for computations need to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature impacts on measurements made outdoors might also be essential.<p>
