<p>In a common residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar earned to his staff members, devices expenses, marketing, utilities, and other costs prior to paying himself anything. Generally this leaves about 6% of profits to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This does not sound like much, specifically if the objective of owning a company was for financial freedom. Plus, this 6% wants the couple of years it required to construct the business and not taking an earnings as the owner. However, this 6% usually isn't completion objective. HVAC company owner should pursue 10-15% by cutting costs in some areas or increasing their revenues while keeping expenses the exact same in all other locations.<p>
