<p>The likelihood of instant reactions to indoor air contaminants depends upon numerous elements. Age and preexisting medical conditions are two crucial impacts. In other cases, whether a person responds to a pollutant depends on individual level of sensitivity, which varies greatly from person to person. Some people can become sensitized to biological toxins after duplicated exposures, and it appears that some people can end up being sensitized to chemical toxins too.<p>
<p>Indoor temperatures are sometimes more tough to control than they seem due to factors such as heat gains from sunlight, outside conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE advises temperatures varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summertime; indoor relative humidity must be kept at or below 65%. The EPA recommends humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to minimize mold development.<p>
