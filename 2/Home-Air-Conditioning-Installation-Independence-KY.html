<p>Expert heating system installations. Nevertheless, even the best-maintained heating unit will ultimately stop working. HVAC professionals advise following this standard guideline when choosing whether it deserves buying a repair: If the system is more than 6 years old, and the repair will cost majority the price of a new system, it's best to buy brand-new. At the 15-year mark, it might be worth changing even if it's still working-- the system will not have many more years left in it, and it's most likely to be using more energy than necessary.<p>
<p>A stopped up furnace filter can trigger a furnace to shut down. Dirty filters are the most common cause of furnace problems. Dust and dirt restrict air flow-- and if the filter gets too clogged up, the heat exchanger will get too hot and shut off too quickly, and your house will not heat up. Change the filter if the blower is running but no heat is coming out. A dirty filter also triggers soot buildup on the heat exchanger, reducing the performance of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>
