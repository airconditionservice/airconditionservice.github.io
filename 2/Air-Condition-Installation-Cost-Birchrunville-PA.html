<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have really little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the vehicle debit, although my company does not provide automobile debit many companies do so they can have a known amount of money coming in monthly, it assists with capital and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. , if we do decide to provide vehicle debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Arrangement..
