<p>For a heated floor location less than 20 sq. ft., you could (most of the times) draw power from a surrounding GFCI-protected outlet without overloading the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is already GFCI secured like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad should be GFCI secured.) However a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can cause overloads and nuisance circuit breaker journeys. For our bigger mat, we elected to set up a dedicated circuit with its own electrical wiring and circuit breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are offered.<p>
