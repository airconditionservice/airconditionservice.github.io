<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company because the two professionals I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts.

The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
