<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outside air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the need to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often done in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>

<p>Have utilized the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. When I have concerns, they give me top priority and a lower rate. Bought a brand-new primary unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever buy prolonged guarantees or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Good investment in my viewpoint. Never attempt to sell me something I do not require.<p>
