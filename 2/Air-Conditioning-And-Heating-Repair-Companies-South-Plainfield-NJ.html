<p>Air conditioning can likewise be offered by a procedure called free cooling which uses pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is included since the temperature level of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, thereby declining its efficiency.<p>
