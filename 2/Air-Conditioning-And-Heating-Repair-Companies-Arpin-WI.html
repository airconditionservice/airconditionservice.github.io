<h3>Air Conditioner Reviews in Arpin WI</h3>
<p>Some a/c systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heatpump, therefore producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also commonly described as "reverse cycle a/c". The heatpump is substantially more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, along with the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system likewise switches roles to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
