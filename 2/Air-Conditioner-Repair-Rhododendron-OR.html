Convected heat systems have been around considering that the days of the Romans when they laid a network of pipelines under their marble floorings and tied them into a warm water supply. Romans used a wood-fired boiler tended by slaves and a primary pumping maker to flow warm water that warmed their stone floors.

Dust and dirt restrict air flow-- and if the filter gets too clogged up, the heat exchanger will overheat and shut off too rapidly, and your home won't warm up. Replace the filter if the blower is running but no heat is coming out. A filthy filter also triggers soot buildup on the heat exchanger, minimizing the efficiency of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>

COP rates just how much heat a system gets rid of or produces (depending on whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus just how much the system utilizes to create the heating or cooling effect.
