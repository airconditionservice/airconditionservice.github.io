Most house heating and cooling systems, consisting of forced air heating systems, do not mechanically bring fresh air into your home. Opening doors and windows, operating window or attic fans, when the weather condition allows, or running a window a/c with the vent control open increases the outdoor ventilation rate. Local restroom or kitchen area fans that tire outdoors eliminate pollutants straight from the room where the fan lies and likewise increase the outside air ventilation rate.<p>

In other words, in-floor heating systems offer a different mode and level of convenience. And, as different public awareness campaigns have long reminded us, the more comfy we feel, the more likely we might be to push down our thermostat, in turn lowering our energy expenses.<p>
