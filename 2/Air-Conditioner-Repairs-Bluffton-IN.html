<p>We tend to think of air contamination as something outside - ozone, haze, or smog hanging in the air, specifically in summertime.

This warmed air is then dispersed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is typically oil or gas, but some are electrically powered too.<p>
<p>Oil heating units are less typical now than natural gas, but they can be beneficial in more remote areas where energies are more difficult to access, and in chillier environments because it supplies more heat per BTU than other solutions.
