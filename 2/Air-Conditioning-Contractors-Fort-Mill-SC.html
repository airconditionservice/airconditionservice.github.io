<p>The quality of the air inside our workplaces, schools and homes matters, especially since we spend most of our lives inside your home. Air conditioners help to dehumidify the inbound air, but in exceptionally damp environments or in cases where the ac system is extra-large, it may not achieve a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned house will increase your energy usage, both for the dehumidifier itself and since the ac system will need more energy to cool your home. A more effective alternative is a dehumidifying heat pipeline, which can be included as a retrofit to the majority of existing systems.<p>
<p>A blocked furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut down. Dirty filters are the most typical cause of furnace problems. Dust and dirt limit air flow-- and if the filter gets too stopped up, the heat exchanger will overheat and shut off too quickly, and your house won't warm up. If the blower is running however no heat is coming out, replace the filter. An unclean filter also causes soot buildup on the heat exchanger, reducing the performance of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>
