<p>We're Not Just Another Duct Cleaning and HVAC Service Company. Another thing to keep an eye out for is the dust that collects throughout summers. The very best thing to do is making sure that the heating system burners are checked and cleaned up thoroughly before chillier seasons begin. Always make certain that the furnace is tidied up each year to prevent soot and condensation which triggers burners to stop working properly. Maybe it is time to start believing about purchasing a new one if your furnace is in an extremely bad condition.<p>
<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that utilizes low-voltage power from the thermostat to switch 220-volt high-amperage current to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can wear and are at the top of the list of typical a/c service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to replace it every 5 years approximately. Unscrew the old AC contactor prior to getting rid of the wires. Then move the wires to the new system (Photo 6).<p>
