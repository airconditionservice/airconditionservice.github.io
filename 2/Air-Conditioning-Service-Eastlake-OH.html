<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your cars and truck's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by distributing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant flows. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine might harm the engine elements. To prevent this from occurring, have your radiator serviced frequently. To have your radiator needs managed by experts, see Acme Automobile Electric & Repair today.<p>
