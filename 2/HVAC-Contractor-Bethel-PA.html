<h3>Advantages of Expert AC Repair in Bethel PA</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Loan and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a government company, performed a research study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it minimizes energy costs by improving air flow. After checking 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study discovered that there was no substantial enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy efficiency.

In other cases, particle levels reduced immediately after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
