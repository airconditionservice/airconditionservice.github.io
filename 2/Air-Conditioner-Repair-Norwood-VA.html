<p>Information supplied in this security guide is based upon current scientific and technical understanding of the issues presented and is reflective of the jurisdictional limits developed by the statutes governing the co-authoring firms. Structures continuously progress as a result of the modifications in the environment around them as well as the occupants, products, and activities within them. The various surface areas and the air inside a building are constantly engaging, and this interaction leads to changes in each.

<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that utilizes low-voltage power from the thermostat to switch 220-volt high-amperage current to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can wear and are at the top of the list of common air conditioning service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to replace it every 5 years or two. Loosen the old AC contactor before removing the wires. Then move the wires to the new unit (Image 6).<p>
