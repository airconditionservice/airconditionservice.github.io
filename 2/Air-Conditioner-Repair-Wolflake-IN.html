A good general rule is to run a restroom fan for about 45 minutes after a shower.<p>
<p>Current Review: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He made the effort to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was educated and respectful. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
