<p>The thermostat is the "heart" of your radiant heat system, managing the power to the heating wires and also managing the temperature level of the floor. All wiring for your radiant heat system either runs to it or from it. Most people will install their thermostat near the entryway of the room they are heating, near the light switches. However, anywhere you install it is fine as long as the location is dry and unobstructed.<p>
<p>Iâ $ m actually picky with my stuff. I like my equipment and devices initial, I wonâ $ t have anything to do with cheap knock-offs.

Itâ $ s just perfect.<p>
