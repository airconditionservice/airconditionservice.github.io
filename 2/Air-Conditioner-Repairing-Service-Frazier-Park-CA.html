<h3>Important Furnace Repair Tips For Your Home in Frazier Park CA</h3>
<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is linked to a remote condenser unit utilizing refrigerant piping between a outside and indoor system instead of ducting air directly from the outdoor unit. Indoor systems with directional vents install onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or suit the ceiling. Other indoor units install inside the ceiling cavity, so that short lengths of duct deal with air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the rooms.<p>
<p>Both should be kept tidy due to the fact that an air conditioner moves heat between the indoor coil and the outdoor coil. This means that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also necessary to routinely clean the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser tidy will eventually result in damage to the compressor, due to the fact that the condenser coil is accountable for discharging both the indoor heat (as gotten by the evaporator) and the heat produced by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
