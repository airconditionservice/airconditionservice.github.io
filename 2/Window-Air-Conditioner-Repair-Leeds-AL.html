<p>Current Review: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and polite. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>

<p>Have used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. When I have problems, they provide me concern and a lower rate. Bought a new main unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever buy extended service warranties or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Excellent investment in my viewpoint. Never ever try to sell me something I do not need.<p>
