<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may think. Since many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet.

But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to use and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
