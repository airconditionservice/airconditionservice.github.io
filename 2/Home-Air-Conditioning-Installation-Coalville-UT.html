<p>Recent Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider since the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>With the cost of electricity and gas increasing, it is essential to have your furnace tuned-up for optimum energy cost savings. This will keep you from needlessly paying more than you should.

More than one case has involved outside water fountains in public attractions. The existence of Legionella in commercial structure water materials is extremely under-reported, as healthy people require heavy exposure to acquire infection.<p>
