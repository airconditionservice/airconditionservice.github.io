<p>Ventilating or ventilation (the "V" in HVAC) is the procedure of exchanging or changing air in any area to supply high indoor air quality which includes temperature level control, oxygen replenishment, and removal of moisture, odors, smoke, heat, dust, air-borne bacteria, co2, and other gases. Ventilation eliminates unpleasant smells and extreme moisture, presents outdoors air, keeps interior building air circulating, and avoids stagnancy of the interior air.<p>
<p>7 To check it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect beside the compressor and the main panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature below the room temperature level, and then switch it ON. To avoid straining an air conditioning system's compressor, wait a minimum of five minutes in between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You must hear the outside compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. If the fan isn't turning, look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this).<p>
