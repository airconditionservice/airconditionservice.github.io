<p>A hydronic radiant flooring heat system works by heating water or glycol in a boiler and pumping it through a labyrinth of pipelines installed under the flooring or right within the floor surface itself.

<p>When the heatpump went out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was really handy in gathering information on the phone and providing clear directions about how to briefly cope with the issue and prepare the heat pump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was incredibly efficient and offered clear interaction about the issue, its solutions, and its future prevention. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd prepared for, and the service was friendly and expert. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will absolutely utilize Stability Energy Systems once again, for office and home.<p>
