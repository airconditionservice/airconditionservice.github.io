<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding task locating the outdoor system as near to your home as possible per my demand. The task took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was extremely well-informed of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained till 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<h3>Outdoor Air Conditioner in Keenesburg CO</h3>
<p>Ducted heat pump heating & cooling systems act just like traditional central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces through a duct system. A ducted heat pump system may be most cost effective if your home or building has an existing duct system that is in good condition. Using existing ductwork will eliminate the requirement to set up a pricey new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>Excellent service within 24 hours and a fair rate. The technician (Camryn) was very extensive and on-time in explaining what services would be performed. Also Camryn provided great customer care at the end of the consultation by describing exactly what he had actually done, the condition of our heat pump, furnace and tankless hot water heater. He made a couple of recommendations of some maintenance jobs we may want to have actually done in the future, however without the high pressure up-sale methods used by some in the market.<p>
<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to offer your house that ideal temperature all year round. But while they're cycling through all that air, they're filtering out some of those common air toxins. Eventually, their air filters fill and stop doing their job. Not just does that cause problem for your indoor air quality, it likewise uses down your AC system, which can result in costly repairs down the road. So, be sure to alter your AC filters routinely, or get an a/c service plan which generally consists of a filter change - especially if you are allergy-prone or reside in a city with high levels of contamination.<p>
<p>Indoor contamination sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the primary cause of indoor air quality issues. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor pollutant levels by not bringing in sufficient outdoor air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air pollutants out of the location. Heat and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some contaminants.<p>
