In some cases, measured particle levels really increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased right away after cleaning however returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>

That's because it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts off before it has a possibility to distribute the correct volume of air past the coils to draw out the required wetness. The result is a space that doesn't appear as cool as the temperature level shows. In reality, the room can feel damp and clammy.<p>
