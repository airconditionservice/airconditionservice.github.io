<p>We tend to think about air contamination as something outside - haze, ozone, or smog hanging in the air, especially in summer season. Connection issues along the line that provides power to your furnace can jeopardize the performance of the system. Loose, faulty or missing wires will trigger the thermostat to lose its connection to the unit and disrupt service. Part of preserving your furnace includes checking the suggested connections along with temperature and pressure gauges. Require time to examine these parts for dust and damage, ensuring that they are secure and tight.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an exceptional job finding the outdoor system as near the house as possible per my demand. The job took two days and my lawn and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was extremely experienced of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can examine and keep.
