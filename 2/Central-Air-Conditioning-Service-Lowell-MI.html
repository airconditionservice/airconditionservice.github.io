From the most standard, 1-inch filter in the blower cabinet, to the bigger, 4-inch media filter often in its own cabinet outside the furnace, to the more advanced electronic air cleaners and air cleansers, all need some fundamental maintenance. These filters help with indoor air quality by trapping air-borne contaminants flowing through your system.

<p>Central air conditioning conditioners, typically referred to as central air" or split-system cooling", distribute cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and registers (i.e., openings in the ceilings, walls, or floors covered by grills) bring cooled air from the air conditioning system to the house. This cooled air becomes warmer as it distributes through the house; then it recedes to the central air conditioner through return ducts and registers. Discover how central air conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
