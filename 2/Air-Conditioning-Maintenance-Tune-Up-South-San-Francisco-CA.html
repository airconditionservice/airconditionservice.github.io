<p>Recognized as a leader in the HVAC market, Bard Manufacturing integrates quality products and impressive service with development and technological advances to provide high-performance heating & cooling products worldwide. A multi-split system 56 is a traditional split system, which is divided into 2 parts (evaporator and condenser) and permits cooling or heating of numerous spaces with one external unit. In the outdoor system of this air conditioner there is a more effective compressor, ports for connecting several traces and automation with locking valves for regulating the volume of refrigerant provided to the indoor units found in the room.<p>
<p>The main problem when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external unit to the internal ones. While installing a separate split system, employees attempt to locate both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Installing a multi-split system develops more troubles, considering that a few of indoor units can be situated far from the outside. The first designs of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not permit you to set the air conditioning separately for each space. Nevertheless, now the market has a large choice of multi-split systems, in which the functional characteristics of indoor units operate independently from each other.<p>
