Then make certain the furnace filter is clean Then go tidy and outdoors off the condenser coils (Photo 2). The reduced air flow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if several registers were closed or the filter was clogged. Deice the A-coil if you have actually altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or up until there's excellent airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it.
