<p>A packaged unit, generally installed on the roofing system, is most typically used on commercial buildings, however it is likewise an alternative for house owners to think about. Often times, these units include not just the air conditioning unit itself but likewise a furnace. A benefit of this system is certainly the cost. Packaged units are fantastic for those looking to conserve cash on the installation of a new cooling and heating system individually, since the system is integrated. Nevertheless, one con is that these systems are usually only offered for larger homes due to their high power and capacity. In addition, while they can be an excellent way to conserve cash on a complete HVAC system, they're still substantially more costly than buying just a cooling system. For that reason, this might not be the best choice for property owners looking for short-term savings or those with smaller sized budgets.<p>
