<p>Examine these three things first if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Ensure all the registers in the house are broad open. Then be sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go clean and outside off the condenser coils (Picture 2). If several signs up were closed or the filter was blocked, the minimized air flow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. If you've altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or till there's excellent airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually solved the problem.<p>
