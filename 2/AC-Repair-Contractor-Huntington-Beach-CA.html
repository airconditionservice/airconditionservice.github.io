<p>After living in our home for 15 years we figured itâ $ s time to replace the a/c. I went on and bought this Provider and I should say it does the job quite well. It takes very little time to warm up or cool off the house which is one of the important things we didnâ $ t get from the one we had previously. The unit hasnâ $ t needed any repair work and Iâ $ ve had it for about half a year now.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is probably frozen. The cause is normally an absence of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without airflow, moisture from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC unit, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and try again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, since something is most likely wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
