<p>We tend to think about air contamination as something outside - ozone, haze, or smog hanging in the air, particularly in summertime. These convection heating systems are still commonly used and are usually called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns."

Because an unit is set up in each space or area you want to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature of each zone, which can conserve energy. Some mini-splits even have tenancy sensing units that instantly raise the temperature level in the space when you exist.<p>
