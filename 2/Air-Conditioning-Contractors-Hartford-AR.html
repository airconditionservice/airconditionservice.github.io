<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Illness is brought on by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The primary route of exposure is through the production of an aerosol effect, many commonly from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads.

The presence of Legionella in commercial structure water products is highly under-reported, as healthy people need heavy direct exposure to acquire infection.<p>
