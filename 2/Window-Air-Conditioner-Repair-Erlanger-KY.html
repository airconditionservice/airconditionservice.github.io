<h3>Commercial HVAC Contractors in Erlanger KY</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you might believe. Due to the fact that many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive versatile tube) instead of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to wear and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
