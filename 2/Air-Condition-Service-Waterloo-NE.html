<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider since the 2 specialists I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>We look at ideas prior to we offer recommendations to change instead of repair a heating system. One of the ideas we take a look at is the cost of energy. If energy bills are high compared to usage, or if energy bills are higher year after year, we know the system is not running effectively. It may be in best condition, but if it costs you more in a year to run than it would cost to change it with a more efficient model, then you would be squandering cash by not replacing the older system.<p>
<p>Filters can get unclean easily, especially if you reside in a place that can be dirty. The HVAC system filters trap all sort of dust, debris, germs, and clean the air. They are accountable for maintaining the indoor air quality. Your HVAC system will eventually stop performing as you expect it to if they're not cleaned up and replaced frequently. The heating and cooling will mishandle and the indoor air quality will worsen. Inspecting and altering the air filters is one of the most crucial elements of HVAC maintenance.<p>
<p>Have used the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. When I have problems, they provide me top priority and a lower rate. Purchased a new main system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never buy extended guarantees or service contracts on anything however HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Good financial investment in my viewpoint. Never try to offer me something I do not need.<p>
