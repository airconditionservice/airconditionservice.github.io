The heat pump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas via a duct system. If your house or building has an existing duct system that is in great shape, a ducted heat pump system might be most economical. Utilizing existing ductwork will remove the need to install a costly brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
