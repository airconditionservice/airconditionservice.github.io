The capability to cool and heat your house at maximum performance will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is currently and the size of your house.

Also a house with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any cracks for air circulation will need far less AC capacity to keep temperatures comfortable. Other aspects that can affect this might be the insulation in other places such as the foundation, roofing, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>

Nevertheless, for most of the US and numerous parts of Europe and Japan, throughout the majority of hours of the year, outdoor air temperature levels are cool enough that the air does not require more cooling to provide thermal comfort indoors. Nevertheless, high humidity outdoors produces the requirement for cautious attention to humidity levels indoors.

Before we design and install any systems, we set up a house energy audit in which an energy auditor will recommend improvements and make estimates for cost and energy cost savings from these improvements.
