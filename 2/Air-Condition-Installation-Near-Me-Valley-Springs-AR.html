<p>Central air is a luxury not everybody can afford, many Seattleites should find ways to fight the heat without a duct system.

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire living space. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning help identify the efficiency of dilution.

When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove wetness, Air cleaning happens. The objective is to offer sufficient modifications to make sure a healthy environment. There are several kinds of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be set up to accomplish this. A common component essential in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side drawing in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies guidance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Design.<p>
