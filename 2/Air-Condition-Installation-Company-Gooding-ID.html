They weren't inexpensive but a fast web search verified WSE wasn't pumping up prices, so I happily had them changed. Nevertheless, a week later the furnace quit working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in exact same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they installed the week prior was faulty. No charge for the visit or the new part. I was really delighted they waited their work and fixed the issue. Will absolutely be using them once again.<p>
