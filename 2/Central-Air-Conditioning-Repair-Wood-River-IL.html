<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is allowed to vaporize, thus the heat exchanger is frequently called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it takes in heat from the inside air, returns to the compressor, and duplicates the cycle. While doing so, heat is soaked up from indoors and transferred outdoors, leading to cooling of the building.<p>
<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) may not be the most pernicious factor impacting indoor air quality, but it is typically utilized as a surrogate for air quality and building occupancy level. The more residents there remain in a space or building, the more CO2 is launched into the air. To prevent CO2 levels from increasing too high-- which can have a negative influence on occupants-- outdoors air needs to be intentionally brought into the building through a ventilation system.<p>
