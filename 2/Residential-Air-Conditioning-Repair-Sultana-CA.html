<p>4 Seasons has actually installed both of my furnaces and air conditioners, cleaned the ducts and done the annual servicing. I have found them to be fairly priced, timely and do great work. When they installed my main furnace they went well beyond what was required and redid the entire plenum and the duct work for the water heater because the specialists believed they simply didn't seem best and they couldn't leave them that way. No extra charge.<p>

<h3>Boiler Installation in Sultana CA</h3>
<p>Wow - just wow. I never have become aware of the $5000 guideline but got ta give whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one indoors and never needs maintenance and one outdoors and needs annual and even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outside furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to buy stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of buy something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are simply crazy and all over the place and I think they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
<p>Ask about training and accreditations. A good location to start is the North American Technician Quality (NATE) certification. It's kind of a minimum requirement for choosing an HVAC company, but a lot of contractors out there haven't bothered with it! Kick it up a notch by searching for Structure Efficiency Institute (BPI) certification. Managers with BPI accreditation understand that the house is a system and see HVAC equipment as just one component (out of lots of) of a comfy environment.<p>
