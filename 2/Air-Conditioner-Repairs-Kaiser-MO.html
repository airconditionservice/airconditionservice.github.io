<p>When your HVAC expert informs you to change your filters routinely, they're not joking. It's as important as a routine oil modification in your automobile. A filthy filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, consume more energy and ultimately reduce its life through wear and tear. Moreover, a fresh, tidy filter better traps impurities and particles in the air. As soon as every 3 months, Energy Star recommends changing your filter. During high usage months, check the filters at least month-to-month.<p>

Carbon dioxide at levels that are abnormally high inside may trigger residents to grow sleepy, to get headaches, or to operate at lower activity levels. Outside CO2 levels are typically 350-450 ppm whereas the optimum indoor CO2 level thought about appropriate is 1000 ppm. 28 People are the main indoor source of co2 in most structures. Indoor CO2 levels are an indication of the adequacy of outside air ventilation relative to indoor resident density and metabolic activity.<p>
