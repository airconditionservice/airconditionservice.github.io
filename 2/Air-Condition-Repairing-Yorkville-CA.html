<p>It prevails to assume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively stable over time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a structure as reasonably the same physical material gradually. In fact, the true nature of structures can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be explained and comprehended as complex systems. Research using the methods ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the constructed environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
