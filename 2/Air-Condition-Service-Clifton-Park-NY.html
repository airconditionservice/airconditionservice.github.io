<p>Learn about PSR Mechanical. The efficiency of an air cleaner depends upon how well it collects toxins from indoor air (expressed as a percentage effectiveness rate) and just how much air it draws through the cleaning or filtering component (expressed in cubic feet per minute).

The long-term efficiency of any air cleaner depends upon maintaining it according to the maker's directions.<p>
