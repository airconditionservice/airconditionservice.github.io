<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Performance (97%) Phoenix Light Task 50 gallon water heater. It went excellent. Working with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. 2 on demand tankless and one high efficiency tank. The team took the entire day as they needed to remove the old water heater and set up all new venting, gas lines for the new high effectiveness heater. We decided on getting something more expensive than a conventional hot water heater as gas is among our biggest energy costs. We feel that this brand-new system will last a long time and usage very little energy to heat water.<p>
