<p>When filters aren't changed or cleaned up regularly, they can become obstructed with particles that can restrict airflow, potentially affecting your comfort and your system's efficiency. Dirty filters can cause extra wear and tear on furnace components and in more severe cases cause the system to shut down entirely. By contrast, replacing a furnace and inspecting filter can generally be carried out in simply a couple of minutes, typically with no tools required. As a preventative measure, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, be sure to shut off the furnace either at the thermostat or utilizing the power switch, usually mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>

Try these techniques to pollen-proof your life, especially throughout allergy season.<p>
<p>If the condenser coils are obstructed, the compressor can shut and get too hot down. You'll experience intermittent periods of very little cooling, followed by no cooling. Even if you make sure" the condenser coils are tidy, tidy them again. Turn off the power. Flip the a/c service and furnace circuit breakers in your main electrical panel to the Off" position. Next, switch off the power change right at the furnace or air handler. Then tug the detach block (Image 1) and clean the condenser coils (Image 2). If the air conditioning service still does not work effectively after you have actually cleaned the condenser coils, set up a new filter and opened all the supply vents, continue with the following repairs. Your AC won't work completely unless you do this.<p>
