<p>On average, an AC evaporator coil replacement costs $675 to $1,300. If your AC unit is wintry, the evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. Likewise, if the a/c unit smells bad, there could be bacteria buildup on the coil. The cold liquid (refrigerant) inside the coil takes in the heat away from your house.

Rather, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier remains in the space as heat, so the space is actually heated up, just as by an electric heater that draws the exact same quantity of power.<p>

You can, however, conceal the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can freely circulate around it.<p>
