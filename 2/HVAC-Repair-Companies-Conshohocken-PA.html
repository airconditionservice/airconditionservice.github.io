<p>Right now, millions of allergen, dead skin cells, building debris, and mold might be residing in your home's air ducts, affecting the air you breathe in addition to the efficiency of your heating and air conditioning system. Indoor air quality isn't on the majority of people's radar. Just 9 percent of Americans consider it a threat to their health, and 70 percent aren't worried about it at all, according to a recent study by the Consumer Reports National Research Center. However a number of the important things people do-- or do not do-- can contribute to the stew of air-borne impurities in their homes and get worse asthma, allergic reactions, and other health conditions.<p>
<p>Geothermal HVAC systems are ending up being common functions of environment-friendly homes as part of the growing green building motion. Green projects accounted for 20 percent of all freshly developed homes in the U.S. last year.

That's approaching 30 to 40 percent of the entire real estate market.<p>

In a scenario where there shows up mold and the indoor air quality may have been jeopardized, mold removal may be needed. Mold testing and inspections must be performed by an independent private investigator to avoid any conflict of interest and to guarantee precise results; totally free mold screening offered by remediation companies is not advised.<p>
