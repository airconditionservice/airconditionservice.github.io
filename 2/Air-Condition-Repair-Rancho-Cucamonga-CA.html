<p>Sean was extremely handy. He is a really pleasant person to deal with. No pressure applied to buy additional things. Answered all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He was able to put surge protectors on the system and do the complete maintenance on the system. that was to make certain they were no problems aside from the blower motor. The only factor he might not set up the new blower motor was since there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he understands for sure what the concern is.<p>
<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, check these 3 things initially. Ensure all the registers in your home are wide open. Then make sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go clean and outdoors off the condenser coils (Image 2). The minimized air flow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if numerous registers were closed or the filter was blocked. If you've altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or up until there's great airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to test it. You have actually solved the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>

<p>Wow - simply wow. I never ever have actually heard of the $5000 guideline however got ta provide whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heating systems - one inside and never needs maintenance and one outdoors and needs annual or even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outside furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to buy stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of purchase something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just insane and all over the location and I guess they know they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
