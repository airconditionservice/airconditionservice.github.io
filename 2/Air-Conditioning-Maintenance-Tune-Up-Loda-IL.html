<p>The quality of the air inside our schools, homes and work environments matters, especially given that we spend most of our lives inside. A/c unit help to dehumidify the incoming air, but in exceptionally damp climates or in cases where the ac system is large, it may not attain a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned home will increase your energy usage, both for the dehumidifier itself and since the ac system will require more energy to cool your house. A preferable alternative is a dehumidifying heat pipe, which can be added as a retrofit to most existing systems.<p>
<p>If you work in building and construction, demolition, painting, with batteries, in a radiator repair shop or lead factory, or your pastime involves lead, you might unwittingly bring lead into your house on your hands or clothing. You may also be tracking in lead from soil around your house. Soil very near houses might be contaminated from lead paint on the exterior of the building. Soil by roads and highways may be polluted from years of exhaust fumes from cars and trucks that used leaded gas. Use door mats to wipe your feet prior to entering the house. If you work with lead in your task or a pastime, alter your clothes before you go home and wash these clothes independently. Motivate your kids to play in sand and grassy locations instead of dirt which sticks to fingers and toys. Attempt to keep your children from eating dirt, and make certain they wash their hands when they come within.<p>
