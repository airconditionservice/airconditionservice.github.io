<p>Great Item! Delivery was kind of weird being that the box was opened and products might have fell out. However after evaluation of contents we assured it was all undamaged. The product was extremely lite weight and takes time to apply. Note: purchase advised non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as advised to the height of the shower head and had to adjust the shower floor and curb to fit. Be sure to enjoy the video first prior to installation and follow all directions exactly. If you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had concerns with air bubble pockets. After contacting support, we fixed problems. I would recommend this item to anyone who's remodeling or installing their bathroom for the very first time. Including a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench soon.<p>
