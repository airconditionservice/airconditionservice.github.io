<p>And it's not just downtown high- and mid-rise homes bringing AC to Seattle. Jamey Stephens of Evergreen Home Heating and Energy has seen the single-family home installation business totally turn on its head the last couple of years. Winter used to be the hectic season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summer season, with their typically two-week AC installation wait times swelling to approximately 3 months. It's been a cultural shift," states Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the climate and the people." And not simply with beginners more accustomed to AC living. Longtime Seattle property owners are finally giving in, he states, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit houses with air-cooling systems.<p>
<p>Installation includes digging deep holes or long trenches to set up the pipelines, so it's labor-intensive on the front end. However, you'll conserve money over the long term due to the fact that of the lower energy expenses. Likewise, a geothermal system tends to last about twice as long as standard air-source systems. The absence of moving parts implies you're less most likely to spend huge on repairs down the line. The buried loop system can be expected to last for 50 years.
