<p>Sean was really practical. He is a very pleasant person to work with. No pressure applied to buy additional things. Addressed all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put rise protectors on the system and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to ensure they were no issues besides the blower motor. The only reason he could not set up the new blower motor was because there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he understands for sure what the issue is.<p>
