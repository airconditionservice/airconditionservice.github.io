<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature is regularly in the series of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), since heat pumps become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is since ice types on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil.
