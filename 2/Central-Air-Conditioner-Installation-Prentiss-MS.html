<p>Called WSE for a regular inspection. The tech showed up right on time and was friendly & well-informed throughout the visit. They suggested changing a few parts that were going out.

I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in very same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they set up the week prior was faulty. No charge for the go to or the brand-new part.

<h3>How Does a Heat Pump Work in Prentiss MS?</h3>
<p>There are many reasons this can happen. The good news is that you can resolve a lot of these factors on your own without the need to call for expert help. Start by opening the heat signs up and then move on to checking the thermostat settings. Next, examine the furnace power, reset the furnace or check the service door cover. You can also inspect the filter to make certain it is clear of dirt and inspect the standing pilot burner to make certain it is lit.<p>
<p>7 To evaluate it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect next to the compressor and the primary panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature level below the room temperature level, and after that switch it ON. To prevent straining an ac system's compressor, wait a minimum of five minutes in between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You ought to hear the outside compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. If the fan isn't turning, look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this).<p>
