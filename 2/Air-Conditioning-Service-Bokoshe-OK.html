In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being kept at a set temperature (which is a standard modus operandi for contemporary a/c) needs that the rate of energy removal by the ac system increase. This increase has the effect that, for each system of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the a/c unit removes that energy. 39 To do so, the a/c unit must increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "efficiency" (coefficient of performance) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is activated, and the a/c has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The a/c's power intake will increase by 50 W to make up for this, hence making the 100 W heating element cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
