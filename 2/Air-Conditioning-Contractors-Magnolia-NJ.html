<p>We tend to think about air pollution as something outdoors - haze, ozone, or smog hanging in the air, specifically in summer season. Connection issues along the line that provides power to your furnace can compromise the performance of the unit.

Part of maintaining your furnace includes checking the suggested connections as well as temperature and pressure determines. Take some time to examine these parts for dust and damage, making sure that they are tight and secure.<p>
<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that utilizes low-voltage power from the thermostat to change 220-volt high-amperage present to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can wear and are at the top of the list of common cooling service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to change it every 5 years approximately. Loosen the old AC contactor prior to eliminating the wires. Then move the wires to the brand-new system (Photo 6).<p>
