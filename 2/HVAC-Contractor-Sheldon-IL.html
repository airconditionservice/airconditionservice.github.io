Similar to other types of heat pumps, ground source heat pumps have their geothermal efficiency rated according to their coefficient of efficiency (POLICE). POLICE OFFICER rates how much heat a system eliminates or produces (depending upon whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus just how much the system uses to create the heating or cooling impact.
