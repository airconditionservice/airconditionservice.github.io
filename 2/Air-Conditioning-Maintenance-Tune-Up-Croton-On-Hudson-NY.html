<p>Indoor air contamination is brought on by burning strong fuel sources - such as firewood, crop waste, and dung - for cooking and heating. The job of an HVAC technician is relatively complicated and can differ substantially from one office or home to the next. Every maintenance job and repair is different from the last. Every maintenance task may need totally various steps and processes than the previous, depending on the age and condition of the system being inspected. Setups can also differ substantially, depending on the age of the structure and how well the existing system was set up. In many cases, completely new ductwork may need to be set up in a structure that had none before.<p>
<p>A ducted heatpump appears like a large central air conditioner system that sits outdoors your house. Heatpump operate on electricity and work like air conditioning unit in reverse, using a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outdoor air.

They can be linked to your existing ductwork, if you are replacing a gas or oil furnace.<p>
