<p>SysTech Style focuses on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for improving and maintaining the quality of the air in and around a commercial environment. The same is true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air before it distributes through your home. Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to stay with and build up on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils ensures dirt doesn't develop and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from collecting on and below the coils, which can trigger mold issues.<p>

<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company since the two professionals I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention step.
