<p>Weatherization usually does not trigger indoor air problems by including brand-new contaminants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can often discharge pollutants.) However, steps such as setting up storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can decrease the quantity of outside air infiltrating into a home. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>Biological pollutants include bacteria, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and cat saliva, home dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are numerous sources of these toxins. Pollens stem from plants; infections are sent by animals and people; bacteria are brought by individuals, animals, and soil and plant particles; and home family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a powerful irritant. It can end up being air-borne when it dries. Contaminated central air handling systems can become breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological contaminants and can then disperse these contaminants through the house.<p>
