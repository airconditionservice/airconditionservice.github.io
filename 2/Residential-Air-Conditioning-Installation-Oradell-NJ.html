<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is often in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heatpump become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice kinds on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system should momentarily switch back into the routine air conditioning mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
