<p>How environment change impacts air quality and direct exposure to air pollutants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being kept at a set temperature level (which is a standard modus operandi for contemporary air conditioning system) requires that the rate of energy removal by the a/c increase. This increase has the result that, for each system of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioning system gets rid of that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioner should increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "effectiveness" (coefficient of efficiency) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is triggered, and the air conditioning unit has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The a/c's power intake will increase by 50 W to make up for this, thus making the 100 W heating aspect cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
