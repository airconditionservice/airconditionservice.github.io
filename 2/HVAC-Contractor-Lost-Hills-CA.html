<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a requirement for air conditioning unit repair, which you should keep an eye out for. First, you ought to examine your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little absurd, but ice on your a/c can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately if totally iced over.<p>
