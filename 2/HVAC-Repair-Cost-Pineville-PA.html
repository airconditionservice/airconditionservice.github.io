<h2>How To Hire Professional HVAC Company in Pineville</h2>

<p>A clogged up furnace filter can trigger a furnace to shut down. Unclean filters are the most typical reason for furnace issues. Dust and dirt restrict air flow-- and if the filter gets too clogged, the heat exchanger will overheat and shut off too quickly, and your house won't warm up. If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, change the filter. A dirty filter also causes soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, minimizing the efficiency of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>

<p>Many central air conditioners are connected to a house's forced-air distribution system. Therefore, the same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are used to disperse cool air from the a/c system. When a central air conditioner is operating, hot air inside your home flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your house. When the air conditioner works however your house doesn't cool, the issue is most likely in the distribution system.<p>
