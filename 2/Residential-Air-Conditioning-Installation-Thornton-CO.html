<p>Your air, heating, and ventilation conditioning system (HVAC) act as a collection source for a range of pollutants that have the possible to negatively impact your health-- pollutants such as mold, fungi, germs, and very little particles of dust. Your heating and cooling contractor should examine and, if necessary, update the structure envelope. For instance, he may seal spaces and fractures in the outer walls and attic floor, or he may blow insulation into the walls, either of which might knock as much as 30% off your cooling and heating expenses. Insulation might be a more efficient service to your cooling issues than replacing your equipment.<p>

Even if you're sure" the condenser coils are tidy, clean them once again. Turn off the power. Turn the a/c service and furnace breaker in your primary electrical panel to the Off" position. Next, shut off the power switch right at the furnace or air handler. Then pull the disconnect block (Picture 1) and tidy the condenser coils (Picture 2).
