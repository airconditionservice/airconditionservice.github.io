<p>In a common residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar earned to his staff members, equipment expenses, marketing, energies, and other costs before paying himself anything. Generally this leaves about 6% of incomes to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This does not sound like much, especially if the goal of owning a service was for financial freedom. Plus, this 6% seeks the couple of years it took to build business and not taking an earnings as the owner. However, this 6% normally isn't the end goal. HVAC business owners must pursue 10-15% by cutting costs in some areas or increasing their profits while keeping expenses the exact same in all other areas.<p>
