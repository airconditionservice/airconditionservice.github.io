<h3>Ventilation Systems in Plant City FL</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never have actually become aware of the $5000 guideline but got ta give whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one inside and never ever requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs yearly and even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of purchase something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are just crazy and all over the location and I guess they know they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>

<p>The primary reason house owners do not buy an HVAC service agreement is the cost. They can cost in between $150 and $500 annually, depending upon the amount of services offered.
