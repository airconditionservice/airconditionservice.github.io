The heat exchanger had an extremely little bubble on the surface which the tech said 'might' trigger an issue in the future.

Without air flow, moisture from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Turn off the AC unit, let the ice melt, change the filter, and attempt again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is most likely wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
