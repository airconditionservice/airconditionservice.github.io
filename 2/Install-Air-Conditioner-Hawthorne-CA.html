<p>To say there are a lot of variables in setting up solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Location the a/c back into its original box, utilizing the dense-foam packing material to protect it from damage.

I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they set up the week prior was defective.
