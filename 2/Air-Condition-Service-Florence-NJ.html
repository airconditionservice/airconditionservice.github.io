<p>Lead has actually long been recognized as a damaging toxic waste. In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Person Services called lead the " number one ecological hazard to the health of children in the United States." There are many ways in which human beings are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, contaminated soil, degrading paint, and dust. When a private breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has actually settled, Airborne lead goes into the body. Before it was known how hazardous lead might be, it was utilized in paint, gasoline, water pipes, and many other products.<p>
<p>The likelihood of immediate reactions to indoor air toxins depends on numerous factors. Age and preexisting medical conditions are two crucial influences.
