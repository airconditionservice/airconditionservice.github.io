<p>Just like homes, the most essential aspect influencing indoor air quality is the existence of contaminant sources. Commonly discovered workplace pollutants and their sources. consist of ecological tobacco smoke; asbestos from insulating and fire-retardant building supplies; formaldehyde from pressed wood items; other organics from building products, carpet, and other office home furnishings, cleaning activities and products, bathroom air fresheners, paints, adhesives, copying machines, and photography and print shops; biological pollutants from dirty ventilation systems or water-damaged walls, ceilings, and carpets; and pesticides from pest management practices.<p>
<p>Most central air conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air distribution system. Hence, the same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are used to distribute cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is operating, hot air inside the house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your home. When the air conditioning unit works but your home doesn't cool, the issue is probably in the circulation system.<p>
