<p>The homes and structure of the soil in an area can impact the rate at which heat is conducted through the ground.

<p>The directions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfortable finishing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the brand-new circuit breaker and last connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We recommend you do the same. As soon as the circuitry is complete, energize the system for a couple of minutes to make certain the controls work and resistance cable warms. Do not put the system into full operation until the thin-set and grout have actually had time to appropriately solidify and treat-- normally two to 4 weeks. Then call the household together and play a game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm bathroom floor.<p>
