<p>EER represents Energy Performance Ratio. The energy effectiveness of central air conditioning units is determined by the number of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set variety of conditions. As mentioned above, a BTU is a conventional system of heat; it is defined as the quantity of heat needed to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The common set conditions are outside temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temp of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why the majority of people do not use this measurement much any longer.<p>

If a source of water or condensation can be discovered, chances are there will be mold growing close by. Repair the moisture issue, either by finding the leak or water source or by dehumidifying the location. Thoroughly clean the area using established health department suggestions.<p>
