The temperature level of the inbound air is reduced, however it is also more humid, so the total heat (sensible heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. Some of the reasonable heat of the going into air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the getting in air is dry enough, the outcomes can be quite substantial.<p>
