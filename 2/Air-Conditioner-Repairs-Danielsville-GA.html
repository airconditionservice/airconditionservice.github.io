<h3>How to Keep Healthy Ductwork To Get A Healthy Home in Danielsville GA</h3>
<p>Throughout winter season, the ground source heat is absorbed by pumping an anti-freeze and water-based  option through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid flows around this loop, transmitting the absorbed heat to a refrigerant by means of the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas. From here it travels through the compressor, increasing the temperature level of the gas as a direct result of the compression process. From here, the gas relocates to the condenser, which moves the heat to the air blowing throughout the home's central heating system.<p>
