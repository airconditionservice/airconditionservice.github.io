<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to finish. I 'd evaluated brand-new systems and installation for months. When I chose to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Ton unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not only was the rate fantastic but Mark went out of his way to customize a few things in my home to make the overall air circulation more optimized. I think it literally just took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my unit set up. I believe any future business related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
