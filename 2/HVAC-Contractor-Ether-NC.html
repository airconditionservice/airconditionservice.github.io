For instance, a 1 ton system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 increase in loads, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This implies a 4.5 lot unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't familiar with the term BTU, it means the amount of energy required to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F Â°.<p>
