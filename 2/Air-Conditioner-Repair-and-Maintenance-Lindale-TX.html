<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff often gets requests for consultation and support in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal agencies. Throughout the 1970s, many homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation step. However, many of these houses were found to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this item. Studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was set up many years ago are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan was able to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>
