Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor toxin levels by not bringing in adequate outdoor air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air pollutants out of the home. High temperature and humidity levels can likewise increase concentrations of some contaminants.<p>
<p>Whether you have central air, a ductless system, or a heat pump, whatever needs to be changed eventually. As devices ages, it ends up being less effective. Central air conditioning systems and heat pumps generally last about 10-15 years. Ductless split systems can last as much as 20 years.

<h3>The Most Common Causes of Blocked Ducts at HVAC Systems</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a federal government company, performed a study in the 1990s to investigate 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it decreases energy costs by improving airflow. After testing 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study discovered that there was no significant improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance air flow or energy performance. In many cases, measured particle levels in fact increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced instantly after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>The condensate drain in your air conditioning unit and heatpump must be without all obstructions and debris. Blockages can block the circulation of condensed water and cause moisture build-up within the system. Excess moisture can cause issues like mold, water damage, high levels of humidity in the residential or commercial property, unequal temperature regulation, bacteria, and jeopardized air quality. A professional maintenance technician will clean the condensate and flush drain to ensure all excess moisture streams away from the system.<p>
