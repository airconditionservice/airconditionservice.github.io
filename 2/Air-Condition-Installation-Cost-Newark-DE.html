Today's heating systems are ranked 90% performance or much better; it is not unusual for a modern furnace to be ranked 94 or 95% efficient. Compared to older models, which might be ranked as low as 80% performance, this can indicate substantial cost savings in annual heating costs. Modern two- and three-stage heaters increase efficiency even further by performing at lower or higher capability depending on the heating requirements of the area.<p>
<p>Steam-based systems tend to be older, and were very popular in the first half of the 20th century, particularly in commercial buildings, apartment and very large houses. Lots of steam and radiator boiler systems installed more than 50 years ago remain operable, since the lack of moving parts makes them less susceptible to tear and wear. A steam boiler replacement costs between $4,000 and $30,000, depending upon boiler size.<p>

<p>And it's not simply downtown high- and mid-rise houses bringing AC to Seattle. Jamey Stephens of Evergreen House Heating and Energy has actually viewed the single-family house installation company entirely turn on its head the last few years. Winter season used to be the busy season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summertime, with their traditionally two-week AC installation wait times ballooning to as much as three months. It's been a cultural shift," states Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the environment and the people." And not just with beginners more accustomed to AC living. Long time Seattle homeowners are finally giving in, he says, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit homes with air-cooling systems.<p>

<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odorless gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the eye, throat, and nose and triggers shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the danger of respiratory infection; there is also proof from animal studies that duplicated exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the development of lung illness such as emphysema. Individuals at particular threat from exposure to nitrogen dioxide consist of children and people with asthma and other respiratory illness.<p>
<p>Indoor temperature levels are sometimes more difficult to control than they appear due to factors such as heat gains from sunshine, outside conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE suggests temperature levels ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer season; indoor relative humidity must be kept at or listed below 65%. The EPA recommends humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to decrease mold growth.<p>
