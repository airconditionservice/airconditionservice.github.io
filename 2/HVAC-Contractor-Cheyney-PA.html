<p>EER represents Energy Effectiveness Ratio. The energy efficiency of central air units is determined by the number of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set range of conditions. As mentioned above, a BTU is a traditional unit of heat; it is defined as the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The typical set conditions are outdoor temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temperature of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why many people don't utilize this measurement much anymore.<p>
<p>Normally the most effective way to enhance indoor air quality is to eliminate specific sources of pollution or to decrease their emissions. Some sources, like those that contain asbestos, can be sealed or confined; others, like gas stoves, can be adjusted to decrease the amount of emissions. In a lot of cases, source control is likewise a more affordable approach to securing indoor air quality than increasing ventilation due to the fact that increasing ventilation can increase energy costs. Particular sources of indoor air contamination in your house are noted later on in this area.<p>
<p>Think about prospective impacts of indoor air contamination if you utilize an unvented kerosene or gas area heating system. Follow the manufacturer's directions, especially directions on the appropriate fuel and keeping the heater properly adjusted. A persistent yellow-tipped flame is typically an indicator of maladjustment and increased contaminant emissions. While an area heating system remains in usage, open a door from the room where the heating unit lies to the rest of the house and open a window slightly.<p>
