Failure to replace these filters as needed will add to a lower heat currency exchange rate, leading to squandered energy, shortened equipment life, and higher energy bills; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air circulation. In addition, extremely filthy or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system and even fire.<p>
