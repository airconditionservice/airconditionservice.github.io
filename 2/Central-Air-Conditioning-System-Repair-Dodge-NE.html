<p>Heating is the largest energy expense in the average home. In really dry environments, evaporative coolers, sometimes referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during heat. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outdoors air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature of the incoming air is minimized, but it is also more humid, so the total heat (reasonable heat plus latent heat) is the same. Some of the reasonable heat of the entering air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. If the going into air is dry enough, the results can be rather considerable.<p>
<p>Both the evaporator and the condenser are sealed. Therefore, an expert service individual ought to be required nearly any maintenance besides regular cleaning. Central air conditioners should be expertly examined and changed before the beginning of every cooling season. However, do not let your maintenance end with this yearly examination.
