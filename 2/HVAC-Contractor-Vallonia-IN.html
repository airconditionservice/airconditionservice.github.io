<p>Reality: Geothermal systems actually consume no water. If an aquifer is utilized to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is gone back to that very same aquifer. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that wasted the water after passing over the heat exchanger, however those are extremely rare now. When used commercially, geothermal HVAC systems really remove millions of gallons of water that would otherwise have been vaporized in cooling towers in standard systems.<p>
<p>A geothermal heating system does not produce its power by burning fossil fuels such as coal, oil, or gas. Rather, it takes in heat from within the earth. Furthermore, a geothermal heating and cooling system utilizes significantly less electrical energy compared to a basic electric heat-resistance heatpump.

<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Found both within and outside, particulate matter is a mixture of liquid beads and strong particles suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, soot, and pollen. The particles themselves are various sizes, but the ones to be most worried about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller sized-- because they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, produced by building, for instance, or the burning of fossil fuels, participates in buildings via natural and mechanical ventilation. Indoors it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Illness is caused by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows finest in slow-moving or still, warm water. The main path of exposure is through the production of an aerosol effect, most commonly from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A common source of Legionella in commercial buildings is from badly placed or maintained evaporative cooling towers, which typically launch water in an aerosol which may enter nearby ventilation consumption. Outbreaks in medical centers and assisted living home, where patients are immuno-suppressed and immuno-weak, are the most commonly reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has actually included outside fountains in public destinations. The existence of Legionella in commercial building water products is highly under-reported, as healthy individuals require heavy direct exposure to get infection.<p>
