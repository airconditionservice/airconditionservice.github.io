<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly used in dry cleaning. In lab studies, it has been revealed to trigger cancer in animals. Recent studies indicate that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned goods are saved and as they wear dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning procedure so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical during the pushing and ending up processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to minimize your direct exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical odor when you pick them up, do not accept them up until they have been properly dried. If products with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent sees, attempt a different dry cleaner.<p>
