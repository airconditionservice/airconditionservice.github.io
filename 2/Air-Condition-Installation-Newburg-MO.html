<p>The effects of lead exposure on fetuses and children can be serious. They consist of delays in psychological and physical advancement, lower IQ levels, reduced attention spans, and increased behavioral problems. Kids, fetuses, and babies are more susceptible to lead exposure than grownups because lead is more quickly soaked up into growing bodies, and the tissues of children are more sensitive to the destructive impacts of lead. Children might have higher exposures because they are most likely to get lead dust on their hands and then put their fingers or other lead-contaminated items into their mouths.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you may think. Due to the fact that most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, affordable flexible hose) rather of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to wear and tear and is easily pierced.<p>

<p>On the interior, warm, humid air from your home's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil soaks up heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is circulated back into your home. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface of the evaporator coil as liquid water, leaking into a pan below. From the pan, the water flows into a drain tube which is generally routed into a basement floor drain, utility sink, or outdoors.<p>
