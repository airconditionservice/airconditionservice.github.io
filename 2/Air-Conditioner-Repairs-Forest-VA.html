Likewise, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted right now, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 journeys to coordinate their deal with a company that was working on the patio where the unit sits. I feel like they give me preferential treatment, and want to pay a bit more for that assurance.<p>
