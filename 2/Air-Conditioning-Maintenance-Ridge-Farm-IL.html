<p>Because my furnace was not working, I called Snowflake Air. Jose and his assistant showed up on time. Jose hung out repairing the problem, all the while discussing everything to me. After discovering the thermostat was not working appropriately. He needed to go get the proper replacement. After the installation of the brand-new thermostat, Jose explained the operation and programing to me. I will certainly utilize Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
