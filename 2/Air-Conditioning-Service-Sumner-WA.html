<p>Fantastic Product! Shipment was sort of odd being that the box was opened and items could have fell out. However after review of contents we guaranteed it was all intact. The item was extremely lite weight and takes some time to apply. Note: buy recommended non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We utilized the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and needed to adjust the shower flooring and curb to fit. Make sure to view the video first prior to installation and follow all directions specifically. If you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had problems with air bubble pockets. After getting in touch with support, we resolved concerns. I would recommend this item to anybody who's remodeling or installing their bathroom for the very first time. Including a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench soon.<p>

<p>AC air handler squealing or grinding sounds. Though most air handlers have direct-drive motors, some older units may be belt-driven. When the belt that connects the motor to the blower slips, screeching sounds from a belt-drive air handler usually occur.
