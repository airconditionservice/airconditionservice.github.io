<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier since the 2 specialists I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
