<p>The use of air filters can trap a few of the air contaminants. The Department of Energy's Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy section recommends that "Air Filtering ought to have a Minimum Efficiency Reporting Worth (MERV) of 13 as identified by ASHRAE 52.2-1999." citation needed Air filters are used to minimize the quantity of dust that reaches the damp coils.

<p>The majority of central air conditioners are connected to a house's forced-air circulation system. Therefore, the same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to disperse cool air from the air conditioning system. When a central air conditioner is operating, hot air inside your house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool the house. When the ac system works but your home doesn't cool, the problem is probably in the circulation system.<p>
