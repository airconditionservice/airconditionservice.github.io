<p>Recent Review: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He made the effort to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and courteous. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
