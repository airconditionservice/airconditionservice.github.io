Nevertheless, many of these houses were discovered to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this product. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was set up several years ago are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
