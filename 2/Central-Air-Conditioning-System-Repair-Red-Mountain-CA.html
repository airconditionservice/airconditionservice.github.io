<p>A packaged unit, usually set up on the roof, is most typically used on commercial buildings, but it is likewise an alternative for house owners to think about. Many times, these systems contain not just the air conditioning unit itself but likewise a furnace. A benefit of this unit is definitely the cost. Packaged systems are great for those aiming to conserve cash on the installation of a brand-new cooling and heating system separately, since the unit is integrated. However, one con is that these units are usually only offered for bigger homes due to their high power and capability. In addition, while they can be a great way to save money on a total HVAC system, they're still considerably more costly than buying simply a cooling system. For that reason, this may not be the best choice for property owners searching for short-term cost savings or those with smaller budgets.<p>
