<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company since the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: They were great! Many HVAC companies focus just on upsell and forget to supply you with the service initially requested. They met my requirements entirely by supplying an expert quote with choices, without pressing extra products. The crew appeared on time, kept me informed as they worked, and finished a little early. The likewise without delay followed up with the essential assessments from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I extremely suggest this company.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire living space. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning help identify the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes result from a mix of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove wetness, Air cleaning happens. The objective is to provide enough modifications to guarantee a healthy environment. There are numerous types of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be set up to achieve this. A typical element required in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) offers assistance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Design.<p>
