This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a structure as fairly the same physical material in time.

Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the developed environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
