<p>How environment modification affects air quality and exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature (which is a standard modus operandi for modern-day a/c unit) needs that the rate of energy elimination by the ac system boost. This boost has the effect that, for each unit of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the a/c unit removes that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioner should increase its power intake by the inverse of its "performance" (coefficient of efficiency) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is triggered, and the a/c has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The a/c unit's power consumption will increase by 50 W to make up for this, hence making the 100 W heating element cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
