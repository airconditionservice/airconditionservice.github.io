<p>Evaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working throughout times of high humidity, when there is very little dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for house occupants. Unlike other kinds of air conditioners, evaporative coolers depend on the outdoors air to be carried through cooler pads that cool the air prior to it reaches the inside of a home through its air duct system; this cooled outside air should be enabled to press the warmer air within the house out through an exhaust opening such as an open door or window. 36 These coolers cost less and are mechanically simple to comprehend and maintain.<p>
