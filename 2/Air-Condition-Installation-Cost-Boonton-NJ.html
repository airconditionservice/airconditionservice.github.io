<p>When our furnace was passing away, we got in touch with 2 local companies for quotes.

Rather than a basic sales job, the owner of the company made a complete evaluation of our heating system and situated methods we might have more even heat. He consisted of these considerable but small modifications in his bid. We decided to alter from a gas furnace to an electric heatpump since of recent warmer summertimes and for environmental reasons.<p>
