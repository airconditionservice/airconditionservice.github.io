<h3>Knowing the Essentials of Furnace, AC and HVAC Maintenance at Troy NC</h3>
<p>A hydronic glowing floor heat system works by heating water or glycol in a boiler and pumping it through a maze of pipes set up under the floor or right within the flooring surface itself. The heat from the warm water transfers to the flooring mass and then radiates through thermal transfer to other articles with strong mass such as the walls, ceilings, furnishings and individuals. It does not rely on heating or moving air to move heat.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outside air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the demand to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often carried out in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
