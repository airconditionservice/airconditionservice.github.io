<h3>The Most Frequent Causes of Blocked Ducts in HVAC Systems</h3>
<p>Aerating or ventilation (the "V" in HVAC) is the procedure of exchanging or replacing air in any space to supply high indoor air quality which includes temperature level control, oxygen replenishment, and elimination of wetness, smells, smoke, heat, dust, airborne germs, carbon dioxide, and other gases. Ventilation gets rid of undesirable smells and extreme moisture, presents outdoors air, keeps interior structure air flowing, and prevents stagnation of the interior air.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He made the effort to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and courteous. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
