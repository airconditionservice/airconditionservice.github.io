<p>All homes require reliable ventilation. There are some circumstances of furnace failure that tend to be more typical than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it might be that your pilot burner has actually been burnt out from usage. Another possible factor might be a damaged thermostat, avoiding the furnace from adjusting to the right temperature. Heaters that kick on frequently might be due to an unclean filter, which is not permitting the furnace to cycle air properly. If your furnace is making a great deal of racket when it switches on or is humming, there might be an internal concern.
