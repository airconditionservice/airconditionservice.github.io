<h3>Ducted Air Conditioning Prices in Camp Meeker CA</h3>
<p>If you believe a mold problem-- either since of visible growth or a moldy smell consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much good if it doesn't eliminate the mold. Mold starts with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can examine and keep. Dripping return ducts can likewise present wetness. Again, if you presume a mold issue, consider having a service company inspect the duct system for leaks.<p>
