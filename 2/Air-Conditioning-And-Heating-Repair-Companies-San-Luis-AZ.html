<p>The split system is the most common. Most people are used to seeing this type in the yards of houses. With split system units, most of the parts are housed in a metal box beyond the home. However, there are some internal parts also. Split systems are perfect for cooling numerous spaces simultaneously, but are not really energy effective.

<p>It is common to assume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, relatively stable gradually. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a structure as reasonably the same physical material with time. In fact, the real nature of buildings can be deemed the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be explained and understood as complicated systems. Research applying the methods ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
