If your home currently has ducts, replacing your heating system with a brand-new, effective gas furnace is a fairly simple process.

<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems utilize capacitors to begin the compressor. The capacitor shops energy, like a battery does, to have power available to the compressor when the thermostat tells it to switch on.
