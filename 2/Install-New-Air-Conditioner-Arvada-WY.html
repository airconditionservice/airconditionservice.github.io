They came and said it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the job, but they needed to buy it. My partner stated that she had seen an excellent evaluation for James, so I called. He came in a few hours (weaving a mask) and discussed the circumstance to me. He said it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 total. He used to come back today, however I moved it to tomorrow.
