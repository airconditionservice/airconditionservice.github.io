<p>My home has 5 units, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" found something wrong with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned up for an additional $30.00.

He is truthful, reliable, and sensible on cost. It's hard to discover a truthful AC guy and I'm thankful I found Luis. Highly advise Luis and his company.<p>
