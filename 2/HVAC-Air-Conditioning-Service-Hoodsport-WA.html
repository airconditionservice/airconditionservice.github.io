<h3>Warning Signs That You Need Furnace Repair in Hoodsport WA</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Performance (97%) Phoenix Light Task 50 gallon water heater. It went excellent. Working with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 various hot water heater. 2 on demand tankless and one high effectiveness tank. The team took the whole day as they needed to eliminate the old water heater and set up all brand-new venting, gas lines for the new high effectiveness heating system. We chose getting something more expensive than a traditional hot water heater as gas is among our most significant energy costs. We feel that this new system will last a long time and usage extremely little energy to heat water.<p>
