Considering that ductwork is so complicated, duct cleaning and duct maintenance can appear very daunting in the beginning, requiring specialized tools, equipment, and know-how. When you opt for Service HQ's duct cleaning services, you will not need to stress over a thing.<p>
<p>The very first a/c and refrigerators utilized combustible or poisonous gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or lp, that might result in fatal mishaps when they leaked. Thomas Midgley, Jr. developed the very first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number suggesting the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A).
