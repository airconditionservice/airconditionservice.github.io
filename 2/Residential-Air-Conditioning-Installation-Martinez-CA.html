However a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can trigger overloads and annoyance circuit breaker trips. For our bigger mat, we elected to install a devoted circuit with its own wiring and circuit breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are available.<p>
<p>To secure family members with asthma or to reduce the possibility that somebody in the house might establish asthma, the house should be examined for potential indoor asthma activates.
