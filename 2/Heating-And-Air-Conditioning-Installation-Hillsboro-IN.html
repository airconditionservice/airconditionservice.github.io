<h3>What is HVAC? HVAC Information For Hillsboro IN Home Owners</h3>
<p>Most residential heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The existing trend in home construction is to decrease air leak through cracks and other openings in roofings, floors, and walls. The combination of these building practices and the recirculation of indoor air has led to an increase in indoor air issues. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) suggests that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor make-up air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living areas of residential buildings. The ASHRAE guidelines for make-up air for bathroom and kitchens in houses are much higher. This fresh make-up air waters down indoor pollutants and helps tire them from the home.<p>
