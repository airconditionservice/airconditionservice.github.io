<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a need for a/c repair, which you must watch out for. Initially, you must check your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little ridiculous, but ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively if entirely iced over.<p>
