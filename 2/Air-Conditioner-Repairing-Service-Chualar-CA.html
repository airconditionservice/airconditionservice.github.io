<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems use capacitors to begin the compressor. The capacitor stores energy, like a battery does, to have power readily available to the compressor when the thermostat informs it to switch on. In time, capacitors can break, and when they do, you'll see the motor running hotter. Before that occurs, you wish to get those capacitors changed to prevent additional damage to your system.<p>
<p>The primary reason homeowners do not purchase an HVAC service contract is the cost. They can cost between $150 and $500 annually, depending on the quantity of services provided. If the system is new and still under a manufacturer's warranty, the cost may not be worthwhile. Any major repairs need to be covered under the manufacturer's service warranty. However, some producers require routine maintenance as a term of the warranty.<p>
<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your car's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by circulating an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant flows. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine could damage the engine parts. To avoid this from occurring, have your radiator serviced frequently. To have your radiator needs dealt with by professionals, check out Acme Car Electric & Repair today.<p>
