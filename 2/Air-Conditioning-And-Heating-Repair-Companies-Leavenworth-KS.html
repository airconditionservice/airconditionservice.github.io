<p>Many people underestimate the level of the indoor air contamination problem. Air contamination is usually imagined as the black smoke given off from factories. Little idea is offered to tobacco smoke and the spin-offs of aerosol sprays, paints, pesticides, and cleaners utilized in the home.

Particulates and irritants discovered in outside air can be asthma triggers. Filtering inbound air for HVAC systems efficiently filters particulates.

<p>All contemporary a/c systems, even small window bundle systems, are equipped with internal air filters. These are normally of a light-weight gauze-like product, and need to be replaced or washed as conditions require. For example, a structure in a high dust environment, or a home with furry animals, will require to have the filters changed regularly than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat currency exchange rate, resulting in lost energy, shortened devices life, and higher energy costs; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air circulation. Additionally, very dirty or plugged filters can trigger overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system and even fire.<p>
