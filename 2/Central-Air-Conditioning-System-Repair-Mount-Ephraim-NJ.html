<p>If you think a mold problem-- either since of visible development or a moldy odor consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much great if it doesn't remove the mold. Mold begins with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can maintain and examine. Leaky return ducts can also introduce moisture. Again, if you presume a mold issue, consider having a service company check the duct system for leaks.<p>

<h3>Central Air Conditioning Repair in Mount Ephraim NJ</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never have become aware of the $5000 rule however got ta offer whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one indoors and never ever requires maintenance and one outdoors and requires yearly or even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to buy stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up rather than buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are simply insane and all over the place and I guess they know they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
