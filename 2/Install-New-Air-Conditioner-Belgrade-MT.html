<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may think. Due to the fact that most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, affordable flexible pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to use and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>
<p>We look at clues prior to we provide guidance to replace rather than repair a heater. One of the hints we look at is the cost of energy. If energy costs are high compared to usage, or if energy costs are greater year after year, we know the system is not running efficiently. It may be in best condition, but if it costs you more in a year to run than it would cost to change it with a more effective model, then you would be squandering cash by not replacing the older system.<p>
