<p>Because it's the most common heating system in Seattle houses, I'll start with a natural gas furnace. Warm air is delivered to the spaces of your house by means of ducts, and cool air is collected through cold air return vents. Gas furnaces are rated for effectiveness. Older systems from the 1970s may be rated 65%, suggesting 35% of the heating energy is wasted during the combustion procedure. Today's models vary from a minimum of 78% as much as 98.5%. If your house already has ducts, changing your heating system with a new, efficient gas furnace is a reasonably simple procedure. Installing a new gas furnace system can be rather costly if you are adding on to your home or retrofitting a home without ducting.<p>

<h3>Heating Company in Walnut Grove MO</h3>
<p>Wow - just wow. I never ever have actually heard of the $5000 guideline but got ta give whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one inside and never requires maintenance and one outdoors and requires annual or perhaps bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to purchase stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than buy something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are just crazy and all over the location and I think they know they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
