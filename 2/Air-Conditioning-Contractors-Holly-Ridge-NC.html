Nevertheless, much of these houses were found to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this product. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was set up many years ago are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
