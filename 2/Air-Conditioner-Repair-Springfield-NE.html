<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high effectiveness, and are in some cases integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summer season a/c. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heatpump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added-in since the storage functions as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (instead of charging) mode, causing the temperature to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
