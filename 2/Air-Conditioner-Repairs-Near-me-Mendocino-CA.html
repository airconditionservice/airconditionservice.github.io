I went through five other companies prior to I discovered Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All five other companies estimated me with different rates and various problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th person, who discussed to me thoroughly the issues which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental house, another event. When I called and he recommended me to call service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the system working once again, he helped me trouble shoot the concern.

<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a requirement for air conditioning unit repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. First, you must examine your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little ridiculous, but ice on your air conditioning unit can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly if entirely iced over.<p>
