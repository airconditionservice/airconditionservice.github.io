<h3>Advantages of Ducted Heat Pumps at Hayward CA</h3>
<p>Most people understand that outside air pollution can affect their health, however indoor air contamination can also have substantial, harmful effect. EPA studies of human exposure to air pollutants indicate that indoor levels of contaminants might be two to five times-- and periodically more than 100 times-- greater than outdoor levels. The EPA and its Science Board of advisers regularly rank indoor air contamination among the top 5 ecological health dangers to the public.<p>
<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, examine these three things initially. Make sure all the signs up in your home are wide open. Then be sure the furnace filter is clean Then go clean and outdoors off the condenser coils (Image 2). If a number of signs up were closed or the filter was clogged, the minimized air flow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. If you've changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or till there's good airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to check it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've solved the issue.<p>
