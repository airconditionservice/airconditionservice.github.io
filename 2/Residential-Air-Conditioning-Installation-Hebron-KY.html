<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Just this morning I noticed I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the exact same day. He understood just what the issue was and fixed it extremely quickly. However here is the BEST ONE. About ten years ago my whole a/c and gas heat went absolutely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan had the ability to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he might have charged me for so much more.<p>

<p>This is especially significant, as gas stoves can trigger levels of pollution that would be prohibited outdoors. According to the EPA, while houses without gas ranges have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), homes with well-adjusted gas ranges have levels that can range from 5 to 15 ppm, and houses with badly adjusted gas stoves can be 30 ppm or greater. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's guidelines.<p>
<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â A lot of heaters have numerous control boards. The largest, or just one in some heaters, is in some cases called the Motherboard. The circuit boards control and collaborate the operation of the motors, sensing units, ignitor, gas valve and more. Do It Yourself repair is possible, but the brand-new control panel should be set up exactly right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work.
