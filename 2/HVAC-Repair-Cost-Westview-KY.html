Too large and you'll run into issues with short-cycling, which can harm the air conditioning unit and shorten its life. Too small and your air conditioning system will not be able to cool the house appropriately. When shopping for a new AC system, these are just a few of the elements that you require to take into account.

As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it takes in heat from the inside air, returns to the compressor, and repeats the cycle. While doing so, heat is taken in from indoors and transferred outdoors, resulting in cooling of the building.<p>
