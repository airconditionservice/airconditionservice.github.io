<p>Current Evaluation: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and respectful. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
