<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company since the two service technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
