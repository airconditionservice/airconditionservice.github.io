<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a requirement for air conditioner repair, which you should look out for. First, you ought to examine your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little absurd, but ice on your ac system can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately if completely iced over.<p>
