<h3>AC Duct Repair in Phoenix AZ</h3>
<p>My home has 5 units, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" found something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned up for an additional $30.00. (He literally stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I got a refund and complained) When this person belittled me for my "not understanding", I tossed him off the property.<p>
<p>In a location where temperature levels reach freezing, air-source heat pumps make great primary heating systems.

The controls will call for the furnace to come on, effectively heating the house in these conditions.<p>
