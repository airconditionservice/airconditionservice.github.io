<p>Your lungs are accountable for bringing fresh air into your body, while simultaneously eliminating waste gases and particulates. Needless to state, the more particles that are in the air you breathe, the more difficult it is for your lungs to eliminate them. Poor air quality - whether it is inside or outdoors - can make it increasingly hard for your lungs to work appropriately, and can have negative health impacts.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and polite. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
