Load determining is referred to as the Handbook J estimation and should be carried out by the HVAC contractor before offering an installation or system cost for a/c. Move to another contractor if your contractor states they know the size of air conditioning system you require based on experience or on square video alone. Just like measuring the size of an unit needed based upon BTUs, determining the appropriate size of unit for your house also depends upon the system load-- how much cold air it will lose by room.<p>
<p>An AC unit maintenance cost can be $50 to $110 for a single see, or you can register for a maintenance strategy with your local heating and cooling company. That will cost about $150 to $300 a year. You'll get one or two maintenance visits annually, plus another service call, a discount rate on parts, and generally some other advantages. Some companies offer concern consultations to their maintenance plan members.<p>
