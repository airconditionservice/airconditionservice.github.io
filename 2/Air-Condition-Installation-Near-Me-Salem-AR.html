<p>The bureau projects 34 percent work growth for HVAC technicians in between 2010 and 2020, more than twice the average for all occupations. Several factors add to this, including the replacement and upgrade of older cooling systems to meet stricter ecological regulations. The sluggish rebound in industrial and residential building will produce a stable circulation of brand-new opportunities, especially for service technicians who want to relocate. New systems are more electronic and sophisticated, so technicians who have actually finished formal training programs at a technical or community college might have a benefit over those who find out on the job.<p>
