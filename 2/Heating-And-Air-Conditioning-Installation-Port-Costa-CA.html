<p>Recent Review: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and courteous. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
