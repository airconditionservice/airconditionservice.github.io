<p>Luis was immediately responsive to email and texts with questions. He committed to the task based only on emails, showed up and provided with a 2 day reverse (Email RFQ on Monday, installed on Wednesday). Protexs offer was among the few reasonable ones received. Others were nearly two times the quantity Protex quoted for low end off brand name equipment. I got Provider. ProTex correctly encouraged me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser even though it would have made them more cash (Honesty) The install team was considerate of my home and installed the equipment in the anticipated quantity of time. post install assessment results look great for braising and pipes quality. New unit cools much better than the 13 year old 4 load R22 unit it changed (also Provider).<p>

If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
