The only reason he might not set up the brand-new blower motor was since there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he knows for sure what the problem is.<p>
<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, examine these three things first. Make sure all the registers in your house are large open. Then make sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go outdoors and tidy off the condenser coils (Image 2). The decreased air flow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if numerous registers were closed or the filter was clogged.
