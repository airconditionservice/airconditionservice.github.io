<p>Power Vac America provides commercial, commercial, institutional, marine and residential duct cleaning and HVAC system cleaning services. The essential portion of your air conditioning is the outdoor unit. Without it, you have no cooling. Depending on its placement on your home and its upkeep, it might sustain some damage throughout the winter. The majority of the time, this simply consists of some accumulation of dirt and particles, which is quite easy to remove. Your Sacramento HVAC technician will wipe the exterior of the unit and make sure that there is no rust, damage from accumulated wetness, or extreme wear to the exterior. They might recommend that you trim back overgrown trees or bushes to make sure sufficient airflow around the unit.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent task finding the outdoor system as close to the house as possible per my request. The job took two days and my lawn and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely experienced of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained up until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
