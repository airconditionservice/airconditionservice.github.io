An oversize compressor also costs more to operate due to the fact that it simply takes more electricity to run a larger system. And a large-scale unit does not lower humidity efficiently. That's because it cools the air so rapidly that it turns off before it has an opportunity to circulate the correct volume of air past the coils to draw out the necessary wetness. The result is a space that does not seem as cool as the temperature level suggests. In reality, the space can feel moist and clammy.<p>
