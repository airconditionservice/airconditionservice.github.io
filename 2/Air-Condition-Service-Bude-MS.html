Nevertheless, anywhere you install it is fine as long as the location is dry and unblocked.<p>
<p>When the heat pump went out in our offices, Taylor at Stability was really practical in gathering details on the phone and providing clear directions about how to temporarily manage the problem and prepare the heatpump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was incredibly efficient and provided clear communication about the issue, its remedies, and its future avoidance. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was professional and friendly. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will certainly use Stability Energy Systems once again, for office and home.<p>
