If you've set up the parts shown and reinstalled the disconnect block, repowered the circuit breaker, switched on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and reduced the temperature listed below the indoor temperature level, and the system does not fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
<p>Air conditioning can also be offered by a procedure called free cooling which utilizes pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heatpump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added due to the fact that the temperature level of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, thus declining its efficiency.<p>
