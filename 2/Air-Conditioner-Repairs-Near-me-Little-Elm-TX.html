<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may think. Since a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, low-cost versatile hose pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to tear and use and is quickly pierced.<p>
