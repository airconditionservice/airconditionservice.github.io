<p>Though it might be difficult to think, the air inside your home can be worse than the air exterior. Dust and dander are notorious for decreasing the air quality in your house, but there are numerous other contaminants that can not only unclean up the air, but cause other health problems. Radon and carcinogens from cleaning materials and building materials add to bad air quality, and can also cause cancers. VOCs (unstable natural compounds) from paint and even from some kinds of carpets and upholstery materials can trigger problems. Mold and cigarette smoke can be perpetrators, too.<p>
<p>Individuals working in buildings with bad IAQ may notice musty or undesirable smells or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about symptoms that take place at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more serious problem. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been linked to IAQ problems. Talk to your medical professional about them if you have signs that are not going away or are getting even worse. But not all exposures cause symptoms, so there is no substitute for good structure management.<p>
<p>It's on days like these that the concept of an in-floor heater appears less like a luxury product and more like a need. (Besides, warmed floorings were excellent enough for the Roman Empire) But before you devote to what can be a significant renovation project, it's finest to ask yourself whether a glowing flooring heater is a suitable service for your particular house heating needs.<p>
