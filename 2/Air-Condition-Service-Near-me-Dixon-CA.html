<h3>Elements of a High Efficiency Furnace at Dixon CA</h3>
<p>A split air conditioning system might cost close to that of a conventional HVAC system however has shown to be an alternative cost reliable option to homes that do not have ductwork. Used in addition to other forms of heating or cooling, such as portable or window air conditioners, space heaters, or oil heaters, it can improve the convenience of your house while keeping your regular monthly utility costs reasonable.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outside air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the need to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>

<p>Even the quietest condensers make noise, so deal with your contractor to discover a location that's not near a bed room or home-office window.
