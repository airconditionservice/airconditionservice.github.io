<p>Packaged terminal ac system (PTAC) systems are also known as wall-split a/c systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are regularly utilized in hotels, have 2 different units (terminal plans), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing unit on the outside, with an opening going through the wall and linking them. This lessens the interior system footprint and allows each room to be changed individually. PTAC systems may be adjusted to offer heating in cold weather, either directly by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to heat the interior and draw heat from the outside air, transforming the air conditioning unit into a heat pump While room air conditioning supplies maximum versatility, when utilized to cool many rooms at a time it is generally more pricey than central air.<p>
