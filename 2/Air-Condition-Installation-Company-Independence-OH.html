<p>Specialist heating unit setups. However, even the best-maintained heating unit will ultimately fail. HVAC professionals advise following this fundamental rule when choosing whether it's worth buying a repair: If the unit is more than 6 years old, and the repair will cost more than half the rate of a new system, it's best to purchase new. At the 15-year mark, it might be worth replacing even if it's still working-- the system won't have much more years left in it, and it's likely to be using more energy than required.<p>
<p>Geothermal heatpump, as well as all other kinds of heat pumps, have effectiveness rated according to their coefficient of efficiency, or POLICE. It's a scientific method of identifying just how much energy the system moves versus how much it utilizes. The majority of geothermal heatpump systems have COPs of 3.0 to 5.0. This means for each system of energy utilized to power the system, three to 5 units are supplied as heat.<p>
