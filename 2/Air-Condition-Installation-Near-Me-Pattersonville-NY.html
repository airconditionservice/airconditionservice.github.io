<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff regularly receives requests for consultation and assistance in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal agencies. The probability of immediate reactions to indoor air toxins depends on numerous elements including age and preexisting medical conditions. In some cases, whether an individual responds to a pollutant depends upon individual level of sensitivity, which varies enormously from individual to person. Some individuals can end up being sensitized to chemical or biological pollutants after duplicated or high level exposures.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts include the advancement and application of multizone air flow and indoor air quality models, particularly the CONTAM series which forecasts air flows and impurity concentrations in multizone structure systems. CONTAM is based upon a graphic user interface that enables the user to draw layout on a "sketchpad" and employ "icons" to represent air flow courses, ventilation system elements, and impurity sources. CONTAM has actually been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transport in big residential, office, and school buildings.<p>
