<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently gets requests for assessment and support in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal firms. The likelihood of immediate responses to indoor air contaminants depends on several factors including age and preexisting medical conditions. In some cases, whether an individual responds to a contaminant depends upon specific level of sensitivity, which varies greatly from individual to individual. Some people can end up being sensitized to chemical or biological toxins after repeated or high level direct exposures.<p>
