<p>The thermostat is the "heart" of your radiant heating system, managing the power to the heating wires and likewise regulating the temperature of the floor. All circuitry for your radiant heating system either goes to it or from it. Most people will install their thermostat near the entranceway of the space they are heating, near the light switches.

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire living space. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning help identify the efficiency of dilution. Air changes result from a combination of natural ventilation (seepage; leak; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. Air cleaning occurs when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate wetness. The goal is to offer adequate modifications to ensure a healthy environment. There are several types of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be installed to accomplish this. A common aspect required in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies assistance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Design.<p>
