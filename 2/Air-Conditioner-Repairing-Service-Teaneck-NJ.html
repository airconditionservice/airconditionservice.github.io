<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You ought to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have extremely small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the car debit, although my company does not offer automobile debit many companies do so they can have a recognized amount of money being available in on a monthly basis, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year.
