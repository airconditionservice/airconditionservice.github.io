PTACs, which are often used in hotels, have 2 different units (terminal plans), the evaporative system on the interior and the condensing unit on the exterior, with an opening travelling through the wall and linking them.

<p>When the heat pump headed out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was very valuable in collecting information on the phone and providing clear instructions about how to briefly handle the problem and prepare the heat pump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely effective and used clear interaction about the problem, its solutions, and its future avoidance. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd prepared for, and the service was friendly and expert. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will certainly use Stability Energy Systems once again, for office and home.<p>
