In tasks where union membership is not an issue, an HVAC technician might complete the assembly and installation of the ductwork that distributes the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system.

He knew simply what the issue was and fixed it very rapidly. However here is the BEST ONE. About 10 years ago my whole cooling and gas heat went totally dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan was able to find out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he might have charged me for so much more.<p>
