<p>We tend to think about air contamination as something outside - haze, smog, or ozone hanging in the air, particularly in summer season. These convection heaters are still extensively utilized and are generally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or gas, however some are electrically powered as well.<p>
<p>Place the solar storage tank near the traditional hot water heater. Make sure that the glycol loop connections to the heat exchanger and the cold and hot water connections are available if the heat exchanger is internal to the storage tank. It is likely that it is supported by the pipes if the heat exchanger is external to the storage tank. If the tank or heat exchanger ever need to be replaced, install unions at the storage tank and heat exchanger connections so that the piping will not have actually to be cut.<p>
