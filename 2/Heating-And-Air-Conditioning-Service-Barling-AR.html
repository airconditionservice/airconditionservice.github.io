<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to end up. I 'd priced out new systems and installation for months. When I decided to final progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Lot system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not only was the cost great but Mark went out of his way to personalize a few things in my home to make the total air flow more enhanced. I believe it literally just took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my system installed. I have no doubt any future service related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<p>For a heated flooring area less than 20 sq. ft., you could (in many cases) draw power from a nearby GFCI-protected outlet without straining the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is already GFCI safeguarded like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad need to be GFCI secured.) However a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can trigger overloads and annoyance breaker journeys. For our larger mat, we chose to set up a devoted circuit with its own wiring and circuit breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are offered.<p>

The cold coil soaks up heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is circulated back into your home.
