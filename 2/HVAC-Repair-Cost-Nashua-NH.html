<h3>AC Service in Nashua NH</h3>
<p>I have actually been using them for many years for my organisations, my own houses and my real estate customers' houses. I went through 5 other companies before I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies estimated me with different prices and different issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth person, who discussed to me completely the problems which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC stopped working at my rental house. When I called and he encouraged me to get in touch with warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the unit working once again, he helped me difficulty shoot the concern. He is honest, trusted, and sensible on price. It's difficult to find an honest AC guy and I'm pleased I discovered Luis. Extremely suggest Luis and his company.<p>

This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's guidelines.<p>
<p>The split system is the most common. Most people are used to seeing this enter the backyards of houses.
