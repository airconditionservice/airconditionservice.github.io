<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company because the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
