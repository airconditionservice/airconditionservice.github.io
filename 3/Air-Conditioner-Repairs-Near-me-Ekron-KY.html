All five other companies estimated me with various rates and different issues that didn't make any sense.

<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your automobile's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by circulating an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant flows. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine could harm the engine components. To avoid this from taking place, have your radiator serviced routinely. To have your radiator needs handled by professionals, see Eric's Garage today.<p>
