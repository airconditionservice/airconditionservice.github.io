<p>Maintenance service was great and on time. Josh was fast and extremely clear about his examination, ensuring I understood what was looked out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So possibly a little high on price for this service, however the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>
<p>Check these three things first if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Ensure all the signs up in your home are wide open. Then be sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outdoors and clean off the condenser coils (Image 2). The reduced air flow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if several registers were closed or the filter was clogged. Deice the A-coil if you've altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or till there's good airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to test it. You've resolved the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
