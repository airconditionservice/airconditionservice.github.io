<p>WE ARE LIKEWISE USING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL COMFORT ASSESSMENTS. Bypass valve: Run a pipe in between the pipes getting in and the water pipe leaving the traditional water heater. Install a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the traditional hot water heater are open, water will flow from the solar storage tank to the standard hot water heater (normal operation). If the valves on the water pipe getting in and the pipes leaving the traditional water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar tank past the standard hot water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summertime when water temperatures are high, and the standard water heater can be turned off entirely.<p>
<p>For instance, issues arise when, in an effort to conserve energy, ventilation systems are not used to generate appropriate amounts of outdoor air.

Improperly situated outside air intake vents can also bring in air infected with vehicle and truck exhaust, boiler emissions, fumes from dumpsters, or air vented from bathrooms. Lastly, ventilation systems can be a source of in door pollution themselves by spreading out biological impurities that have multiplied in cooling towers, humidifiers, dehumidifiers, air conditioning system, or the within surface areas of ventilation duct.<p>

As a society, we make sure that our homes are well-sealed and well-insulated, however we do not think enough about exposure to all the things we position in our houses," says Susan Olesik, PhD, Teacher of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio.

Furthermore, throughout winter, the heat from underground can be soaked up to heat domestic water along with its primary purpose of supplying area heating.
