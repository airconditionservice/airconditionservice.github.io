It's been a cultural shift," states Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the environment and the people." And not just with beginners more familiar with AC living. Longtime Seattle house owners are finally giving in, he says, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit homes with air-cooling systems.<p>
