<p>3. Gas Heating systems While the cost of heating your home with a gas furnace is usually greater than numerous heatpump choices, they can still be extremely efficient, depending on the model you acquire. Among the primary benefits of gas heating is that due to the combustion process, it will heat the air to higher temperatures than other heating alternatives. This indicates it can warm up your house to the preferred temperature level quicker than a heatpump can.<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, damp air from your house's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil soaks up heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is distributed back into your house. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface of the evaporator coil as liquid water, dripping into a pan listed below. From the pan, the water streams into a drain tube which is typically routed into a basement flooring drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>
