<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is permitted to evaporate, thus the heat exchanger is frequently called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it soaks up heat from the inside air, returns to the compressor, and repeats the cycle. At the same time, heat is absorbed from inside your home and transferred outdoors, leading to cooling of the building.<p>
<p>Carbon monoxide gas (CO) is an odorless, colorless hazardous gas. Due to the fact that it is impossible to see, taste or smell, CO can kill you prior to you know it is in your home. At lower levels of exposure, CO causes moderate impacts that are typically mistaken for the influenza. These symptoms include headaches, dizziness, disorientation, queasiness and fatigue.
