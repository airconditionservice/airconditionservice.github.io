Natural ventilation schemes can utilize very little energy, but care must be required to ensure comfort. In warm or humid climates, keeping thermal comfort entirely through natural ventilation might not be possible. Cooling systems are utilized, either as supplements or backups. Air-side economizers also utilize outside air to condition spaces, but do so utilizing fans, ducts, dampers, and control systems to introduce and disperse cool outside air when suitable.<p>
