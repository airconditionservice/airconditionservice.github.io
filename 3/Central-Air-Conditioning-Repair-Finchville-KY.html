<p>RMI is working to alter that, starting in California. As a first step, in April RMI testified prior to the California Air Resources Board, asking the company to set more powerful indoor guidelines based upon the most current science for NO2. The state of California has the authority to regulate indoor appliances through codes, and after stronger guidelines are set there is an opportunity to work on enforcement.<p>
<p>Cooling can likewise be offered by a process called totally free cooling which uses pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added due to the fact that the temperature of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, consequently declining its efficiency.<p>
