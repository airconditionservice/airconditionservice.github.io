In this case, the heat pump is utilized effectively throughout the milder temperature levels, and the system is switched to the traditional heat source when the outdoor temperature is lower.<p>
<p>Current Review: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great.

He took the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and polite. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>

<p>After the system has actually been checked for leaks, carefully insulate all of the glycol and water lines. Water piping can be insulated with basic foam pipe insulation. Glycol piping and external heat exchangers should be insulated with fiberglass pipeline insulation. Duct tape can be utilized on the joints of the water piping insulation, and utilize the joint tape that comes with fiberglass piping insulation. Insulation exposed to sunshine can be protected by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation utilized outside should be safeguarded with PVC insulation covers.<p>
