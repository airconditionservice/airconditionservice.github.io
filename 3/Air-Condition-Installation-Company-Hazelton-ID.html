<p>Some cooling systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heat pumps, therefore producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment.

When the heat pump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit likewise switches roles to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outside air).<p>
