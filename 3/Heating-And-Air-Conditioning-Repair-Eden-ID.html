<p>The Canada Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a government firm, performed a research study in the 1990s to examine two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it lowers energy expenses by enhancing airflow. After testing 33 houses in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the research study discovered that there was no substantial improvement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy effectiveness. In some cases, determined particle levels in fact increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased instantly after cleaning however went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>

As an outcome, there has been an increase in the occurrence of reported health issue.<p>
