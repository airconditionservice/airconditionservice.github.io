<h3>Ductless Air Conditioning For Amherst NH Homes With No Air Ducts</h3>
<p>The Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a federal government firm, carried out a study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it lowers energy costs by improving airflow. After testing 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the research study found that there was no considerable enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy performance. In some cases, measured particle levels really increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced instantly after cleaning however returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
