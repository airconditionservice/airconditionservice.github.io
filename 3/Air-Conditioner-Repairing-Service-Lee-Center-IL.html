<p>SysTech Design concentrates on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for improving and keeping the quality of the air in and around an industrial environment. The very same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air before it circulates through your house. Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to stick to and develop on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils ensures dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It likewise avoids water from building up on and below the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>

Radon gas goes into homes through dirt floors, cracks in concrete walls and floorings, floor drains, and sumps. Direct exposure to radon becomes an issue when radon ends up being trapped in buildings and concentrations construct up indoors.<p>
