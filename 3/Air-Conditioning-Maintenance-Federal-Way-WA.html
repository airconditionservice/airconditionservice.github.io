<p>Due to the present Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to help keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its best. The capability to cool and heat your home at optimal performance will depend a lot on how well insulated your home is currently and the size of your home. A 2500 square foot house will require a much bigger AC unit than a smaller sized house, which will affect installation expenses. Also a home with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any cracks for air flow will require far less AC capability to keep temperatures comfortable. Other elements that can affect this might be the insulation somewhere else such as the foundation, roof, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>

<p>As with many home enhancement tasks, the cost of a complete central heater can differ widely based upon the size of the house. Most heaters will last between 15 and twenty years.
