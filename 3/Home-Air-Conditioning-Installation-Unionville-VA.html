<h3>Why You Want Air Conditioning Repair in Unionville VA?</h3>
<p>Luis was instantly responsive to email and texts with questions. He dedicated to the task based only on emails, showed up and delivered with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs offer was one of the couple of sensible ones received. Others were almost twice the amount Protex priced quote for low end off brand devices. I got Carrier. ProTex properly recommended me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser despite the fact that it would have made them more money (Sincerity) The install team was considerate of my home and installed the devices in the anticipated quantity of time. post install examination results look very good for braising and plumbing quality. New unit cools much better than the 13 years of age 4 ton R22 unit it replaced (also Carrier).<p>
<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most common blend used in autos in the U.S. till 1994, when most designs changed to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting capacity of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer produced in the U.S. for this type of application, but is still imported and can be acquired and used by licensed HVAC service technicians. For systems requiring only a periodic "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in excellent working order and carrying out far better than essentially all "R-134a" systems whether "transformed" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is considered "cheap" by lots of people.<p>

<p>Evaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working throughout times of high humidity, when there is very little dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for house residents. Unlike other types of a/c, evaporative coolers depend on the outside air to be channeled through cooler pads that cool the air before it reaches the inside of a house through its duct system; this cooled outside air must be permitted to push the warmer air within your house out through an exhaust opening such as an open door or window. 36 These coolers cost less and are mechanically basic to keep and understand.<p>
