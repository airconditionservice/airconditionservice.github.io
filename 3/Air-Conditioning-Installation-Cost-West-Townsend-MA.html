<p>A lot of central air conditioners are connected to a home's forced-air distribution system. Therefore, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are utilized to distribute cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioner is running, hot air inside your house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your house. When the air conditioning unit works but the house does not cool, the issue is probably in the distribution system.<p>
