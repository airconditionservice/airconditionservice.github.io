<p>Buildings are developed or planned to react actively to some of these changes in and around them with heating, cooling, ventilating, air cleaning or illuminating systems. We clean, sanitize, and keep surfaces to enhance their appearance, performance, or durability. In other cases, such changes subtly or perhaps drastically change buildings in manner ins which might be important to their own integrity or their effect on structure residents through the development of the physical, chemical, and biological processes that define them at any time. We may find it useful to combine the tools of the physical sciences with those of the life sciences and, especially, some of the methods used by researchers studying environments, in order to get a boosted understanding of the environments in which we spend the majority of our time, our buildings.<p>
<p>We look at hints before we supply suggestions to change instead of repair a heating system. Among the ideas we look at is the cost of energy. If energy bills are high compared to usage, or if energy expenses are higher every year, we understand the unit is not running efficiently. It may be in perfect condition, however if it costs you more in a year to run than it would cost to change it with a more efficient model, then you would be losing money by not replacing the older unit.<p>
<p>Normally the most effective way to enhance indoor air quality is to eliminate private sources of pollution or to decrease their emissions. Some sources, like those that contain asbestos, can be sealed or enclosed; others, like gas stoves, can be adjusted to reduce the amount of emissions. In most cases, source control is likewise a more cost-efficient method to securing indoor air quality than increasing ventilation due to the fact that increasing ventilation can increase energy expenses. Specific sources of indoor air contamination in your home are noted later in this section.<p>
