<p>I am replacing our High Velocity System due to the fact that of a serious refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11. The installer will be utilizing the above noted equipment, a Carrier, Convenience Series Single Stage Condenser, 31,000 BTUs. They are likewise installing an Unico single Phase Blower module, and a Unico Evaporator Coil, 31,000 BTUs and a 12 SEER. They will be adding 3 (3) high speed supply lines and reuse the existing 17 supply lines. They will likewise recycle the refrigerant lines and leave the R-11 refrigerant and replace with a R410 refrigerant. They will likewise install a Honeywell 5000 programmable cooling thermostat. I also have a choice for an extra $2,818.00 to set up a Carrier Efficiency Series two-stage condenser (31,000 BTUs and a 14 SEER); a Unico two-stage blower module and a Unico R-410 Evaporator Coil module that are both ranked at 14 SEER and are 31,000 BTUs.<p>
<p>Next, and possibly just as important when it comes to central air conditioning costs, is the AC unit's size. A system that is too large will have a simple time keeping the home cool, however will have a harder time eliminating humidity from the air. On the other hand, an unit that is too small will not have the ability to appropriately cool the home on hot days. Thinking about bigger systems cost more than smaller sized units, it pays to ask a local HVAC professional what size AC unit your central air system needs to hold.<p>
<p>The predominant health effect related to exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels may position risks, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Significant health companies (like the Centers for Illness Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes countless preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number might range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. If you smoke and your home has high radon levels, your risk of lung cancer is particularly high.<p>
