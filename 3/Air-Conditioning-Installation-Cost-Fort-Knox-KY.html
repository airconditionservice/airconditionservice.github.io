<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a need for a/c repair, which you should look out for. First, you must check your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little ridiculous, however ice on your air conditioner can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
