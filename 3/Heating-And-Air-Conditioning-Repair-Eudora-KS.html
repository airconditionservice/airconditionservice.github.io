The heat exchanger passages have extremely little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the auto debit, although my company does not offer auto debit numerous companies do so they can have a known quantity of cash coming in each month, it assists with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. , if we do choose to offer automobile debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Arrangement..
