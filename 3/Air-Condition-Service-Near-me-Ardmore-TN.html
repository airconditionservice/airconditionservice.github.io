<p>Recent Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier because the 2 technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
