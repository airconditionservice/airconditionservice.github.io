<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is often in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps become ineffective in more extreme cold. This is because ice forms on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system need to momentarily change back into the regular a/c mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost.
