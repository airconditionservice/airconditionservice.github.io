<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently gets ask for assessment and help in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal firms. During the 1970s, many homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation measure. Nevertheless, a number of these houses were found to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this product.
