<p>Due to the current Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to help keep your house's Indoor Air Quality at its best. The ability to cool and heat your home at maximum effectiveness will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is currently and the size of your home.

Likewise a house with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no fractures for air circulation will require far less AC capability to keep temperature levels comfy. Other elements that can affect this might be the insulation somewhere else such as the foundation, roof, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>

The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) provides guidance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Design.<p>
