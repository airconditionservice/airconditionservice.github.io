<h3>Heat Pump Air Conditioner in Euclid OH</h3>
<p>My home has 5 systems, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" discovered something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned up for an additional $30.00. (He actually stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I complained and got a refund) When this person belittled me for my "not understanding", I threw him off the residential or commercial property.<p>
<p>There is a required balance in making your decision though as systems with greater AFUE ratings typically include higher price. So, make sure to choose based on how often you will utilize your heating unit, the load that will be put on it and the frequency with which you plan on having it serviced each year. For a lot of temperate climates with low heating loads in the winter, having a very high ranked heating system is not always needed.<p>
<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider because the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
