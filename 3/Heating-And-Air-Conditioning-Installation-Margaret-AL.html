<p>Changing a capacitor is simple. Just take a photo of the wires prior to detaching anything (you may require a referral later on). Then discharge the saved energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp connectors need to snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. If it's not, get rid of the adapter and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you've switched all the wires, secure the new capacitor (Photo 5).<p>
