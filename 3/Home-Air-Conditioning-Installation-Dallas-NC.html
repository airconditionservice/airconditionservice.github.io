<p>It is common to presume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady in time. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the frustrating bulk of the mass of product in a structure as relatively the same physical material over time. In fact, the true nature of structures can be deemed the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be described and comprehended as complex systems. Research study using the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment considering the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
