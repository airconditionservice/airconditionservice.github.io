<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent job finding the outside system as near the house as possible per my request. The job took two days and my backyard and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was extremely educated of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed up until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>I am extremely pleased with this company. One of my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the issue within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call company several years earlier and know the importance of having the right parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm likewise impressed that he appeared at my house at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will absolutely be utilizing Waycoff's again, and would suggest them to everybody. Thank You quite.<p>
<p>Regardless of the type of electric radiant floor heater, all are factory-built to remain in one piece and not cut, broken or altered. Any interference or disruption in the flow of electrical energy makes the system unusable. This is among the downsides to installing an electric radiant heat system. However, presuming they are set up correctly and appropriately looked after, the possibility of them having problems is small.<p>
