<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that uses low-voltage power from the thermostat to switch 220-volt high-amperage present to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can break and are at the top of the list of common cooling service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to change it every 5 years or so.

<p>Just like a lot of house improvement tasks, the cost of a full central heating unit can vary extensively based upon the size of the house. The majority of heating systems will last in between 15 and twenty years. In selecting a furnace, homeowner must consider heat output and efficiency. Heat output is determined in British Thermal Systems, or BTUs, and the size of the furnace must be matched to the size of the home. A small house, for instance, may not be well served by a high-BTU furnace. The furnace may heat the house too rapidly and turn off for too long, resulting in inconsistent temperature levels.<p>
