<h3>The Benefits of Buying A New Furnace at Lexington AL</h3>
<p>Most residential heating, ventilation, and a/c (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The present pattern in house construction is to minimize air leak through fractures and other openings in roofings, floors, and walls. The combination of these building practices and the recirculation of indoor air has caused an increase in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) suggests that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside make-up air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living locations of residential buildings. The ASHRAE guidelines for makeup air for bathroom and kitchens in houses are much higher. This fresh cosmetics air helps and dilutes indoor contaminants tire them from the home.<p>
