<p>We are OPEN as an "Essential Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds incredible, however furnace technicians often discover that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be turned on. Search for a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Check the breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be completely depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>The very first ac system and fridges used harmful or flammable gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or propane, that might result in deadly mishaps when they dripped. Thomas Midgley, Jr. created the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number indicating the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The blend most used in direct-expansion house and structure convenience cooling is an HCFC called chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>

<p>When the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high enough temperature level, a blower fan will start to present air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger permits air to be heated without coming in contact with the real flame or burner location. Once it reaches an adequate temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the house's duct, supplying warm air to individual bedrooms, living spaces and kitchen areas through the vents or registers.<p>
