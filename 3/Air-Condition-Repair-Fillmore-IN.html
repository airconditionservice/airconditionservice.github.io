Not all heating systems are good for all houses, and there are a number of elements that definitely require to be considered prior to picking one. First, you'll require one that is properly sized for your house.

<p>When our furnace was passing away, we called 2 local companies for bids. While both were helpful and handy, Ballard Natural Gas offered us a better deal, for exceptional service. Instead of an easy sales job, the owner of the company made a full evaluation of our heating system and situated ways we might have more even heat. He consisted of these considerable but minor changes in his bid. Because of current warmer summers and for ecological factors, we chose to alter from a gas furnace to an electric heat pump.<p>

If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outside unit we'll be frozen too.
