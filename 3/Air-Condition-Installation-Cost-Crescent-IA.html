<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a requirement for air conditioning unit repair, which you should watch out for. Initially, you should examine your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little unreasonable, however ice on your a/c can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
