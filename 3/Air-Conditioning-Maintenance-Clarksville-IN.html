<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) describes air quality in indoor workplace, classroom or lab environments, instead of industrial or outside settings. In jobs where union subscription is not a concern, an HVAC technician may complete the assembly and installation of the ductwork that disperses the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system. This consists of cutting the sheet metal to form the ducts, attaching the ducts to the HVAC system, and mounting the ductwork in the building. It may also include the installation of registers where the ductwork connects to private areas.<p>
