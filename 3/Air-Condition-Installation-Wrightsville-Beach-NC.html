<h3>Advantages of Expert AC Repair in Wrightsville Beach NC</h3>

In this case, the heat pump is used effectively throughout the milder temperature levels, and the system is switched to the standard heat source when the outdoor temperature is lower.<p>
<p>An undersize system will not be able to cool rooms down entirely on the hottest days and will cost more to operate because it has to run longer than a properly sized unit. An oversize compressor also costs more to run due to the fact that it simply takes more electrical power to run a bigger system. And an oversize system does not lower humidity successfully. That's because it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts off prior to it has a chance to flow the appropriate volume of air past the coils to extract the needed wetness. The outcome is a space that does not seem as cool as the temperature level suggests. In truth, the space can feel wet and clammy.<p>
