<p>Some cooling systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heatpump, for that reason producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also commonly referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioner". The heat pump is significantly more energy effective than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, as well as the heat from bought electrical energy. When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system likewise switches functions to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
<p>When the heat pump headed out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was really practical in gathering information on the phone and offering clear instructions about how to temporarily manage the issue and prepare the heat pump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was incredibly effective and offered clear interaction about the problem, its treatments, and its future avoidance. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd prepared for, and the service was friendly and professional. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will absolutely use Integrity Energy Systems again, for office and house.<p>
