<p>We're Not Simply Another Duct Cleaning and HVAC Service Company. Building-Related Health Problem (BRI) refers to less regular (but often more serious) cases of individuals ending up being ill after being in a specific structure at a specific time. In these cases, there is normally a similar set of scientific signs experienced by the individuals and a clear cause can frequently be found upon investigation. Legionnaires Illness is an example of BRI brought on by germs which can pollute a structure's air conditioning system.<p>
<p>A ducted heat pump appears like a big central air conditioner system that sits outside your home. Heatpump work on electricity and work like a/c unit in reverse, using a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outside air. This permits them to produce two to three times as much heat as a standard electric heating system (like an area heating system) with the exact same quantity of electrical power. They can be linked to your existing ductwork, if you are changing a gas or oil furnace.<p>

Installing a brand-new geothermal heatpump to work with an existing ground loop is far more affordable.<p>
<p>Ventilation: Decreasing pollutant concentration by using cleaner (outside) air to water down contaminated (indoor) air. Local building regulations likely specify the amount (and in some cases quality) of outside air that should be continuously provided in your structures, as do voluntary standards set by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHREA). Momentarily increasing ventilation combined with correct use of the exhaust system while painting or applying pesticides, for example, can be beneficial in diluting the concentration of toxic fumes in the air.<p>
