All five other companies quoted me with various prices and various issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th person, who discussed to me thoroughly the problems which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC quit working at my rental home. When I called and he recommended me to call guarantee which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the system working once again, he helped me trouble shoot the problem. He is honest, dependable, and affordable on rate. It's hard to discover a sincere AC man and I'm glad I discovered Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>
