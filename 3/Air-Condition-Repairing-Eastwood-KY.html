<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a need for a/c unit repair, which you ought to look out for. First, you need to check your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little unreasonable, however ice on your a/c can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively if totally iced over.<p>
