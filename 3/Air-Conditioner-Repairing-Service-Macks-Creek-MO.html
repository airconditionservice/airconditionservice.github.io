<p>The term radiant heat covers a number of various system types. Most typical are boilers, which are termed hydronic radiant heat systems, and electric systems, which are often described as just radiant systems. Electric radiant heating systems have heating components installed in the subfloor of each space in the home, periodically connected to terminal systems like baseboard heating units. When the system remains in use, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating elements throughout the house. Heat radiates out from the heating aspects, through the flooring, and into the room. This is why the approach is referred to as radiant heating.<p>
