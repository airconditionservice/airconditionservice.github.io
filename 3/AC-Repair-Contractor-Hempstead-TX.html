<p>Discover PSR Mechanical. The efficiency of an air cleaner depends on how well it gathers toxins from indoor air (revealed as a portion efficiency rate) and just how much air it draws through the cleaning or filtering aspect (expressed in cubic feet per minute). A really efficient collector with a low air-circulation rate will not work, nor will a cleaner with a high air-circulation rate but a less effective collector. The long-term efficiency of any air cleaner depends upon keeping it according to the maker's instructions.<p>

<p>If you suspect a mold problem-- either due to the fact that of noticeable growth or a musty smell regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much excellent if it does not get rid of the mold. Mold begins with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can check and maintain. Dripping return ducts can also introduce moisture. Once again, if you presume a mold issue, consider having a service company check the duct system for leakages.<p>
