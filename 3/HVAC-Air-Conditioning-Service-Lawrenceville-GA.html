All of the current furnaces are far more energy-efficient than those installed even twenty years ago.

Office temperatures should be kept in between 68 degrees- 75 degrees Fahrenheit and humidity levels in between 30%- 60%. In addition, drafts brought on by too much air blood circulation need to be prevented.<p>

<p>What do you do when the company that's offering the service agreement tries to upsell you every time they come to carry out routine maintenance? If the coils were cleaned in March 2015, why would they be showing "excessive rust" in June 2015 and need a deep cleaning for $400? They offered her a Reme Halo for $1,300, offering her a 10% discount if she renewed her PMA for seven years, even though it was 6 months before the current one expired. She didn't require a air filtering system, however they talked her into it.<p>
