<p>We take a look at ideas before we supply recommendations to change instead of repair a heating unit. Among the clues we look at is the cost of energy. If energy expenses are high compared to usage, or if energy costs are higher year after year, we understand the unit is not running effectively. It may be in ideal condition, but if it costs you more in a year to run than it would cost to change it with a more efficient model, then you would be losing cash by not replacing the older unit.<p>
