Many common building products used before 1975 consist of asbestos, such as some flooring tiles, ceiling tiles, shingles, fireproofing, heater, pipeline wrap, taping muds, mastics, and other insulation materials. Normally, substantial releases of asbestos fiber do not take place unless the structure products are disrupted, such as by cutting, sanding, drilling, or structure renovation.
