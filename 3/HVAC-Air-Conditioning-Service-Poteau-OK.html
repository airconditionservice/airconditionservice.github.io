<h3>Typical HVAC Services Offered by a Poteau OK HVAC Company</h3>
<p>Many residential heating, ventilation, and a/c (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The present trend in house building is to lower air leakage through fractures and other openings in roofing systems, walls, and floors. The mix of these construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has actually resulted in a boost in indoor air issues. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) suggests that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside makeup air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living locations of residential structures. The ASHRAE standards for makeup air for bathroom and kitchens in homes are much greater. This fresh make-up air helps and dilutes indoor contaminants exhaust them from the house.<p>

<h3>Air Condition System in Poteau OK</h3>
<p>There is a transformer in your a/c furnace. The transformer is what supplies 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. Your Nest won't come on if your transformer malfunctions. Your transformer converts the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends power to your common wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency safety switches that secure your air conditioning system from flooding. One of the most common locations for emergency ac repair midtown Tx security switches is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. It is a great possibility; you might have a water leak in the attic if your Nest is showing a blank screen.
