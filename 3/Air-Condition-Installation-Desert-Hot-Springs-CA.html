<p>Have used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. When I have problems, they give me top priority and a lower rate. Bought a brand-new main system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever buy prolonged guarantees or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Great financial investment in my opinion. Never attempt to offer me something I don't require.<p>
