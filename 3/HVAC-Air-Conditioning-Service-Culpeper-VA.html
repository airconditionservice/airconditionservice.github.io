<h3>Furnace Maintenance  in Culpeper VA</h3>
<p>Wow - just wow. I never have actually heard of the $5000 rule but got ta provide whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one inside and never needs maintenance and one outdoors and needs annual and even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outside furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than purchase something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just crazy and all over the location and I think they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>

<p>When they put a 24 hour emergency ac repair demand, the majority of Midtown Houston Tx consumers don't know why their HVAC unit is not working. The copper lines at the outside system we'll be frozen too if your evaporator coil is frozen. Depending on how thick the ice accumulation is at your condensing system, then you'll have a good idea of how thick the ice build-up remains in the evaporator coil. The first thing you need to do is to examine your conditioning filters. If your filter is dirty, you're in luck, that's more than likely your issue. The next step is to defrost your air conditioning equipment if you discovered that your conditioning filter requires replacing. The most convenient way to defrost your HVAC equipment is to leave the unit off for a couple of hours, with the blower fan running.<p>
