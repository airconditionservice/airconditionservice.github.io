<h3>Three Essential Spring Furnace Maintenance Tips in Saginaw AL</h3>
<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil modification' kind of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had an extremely little bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'could' trigger a problem in the future. So he said I might switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the very same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>Recent Review: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was polite and experienced. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
