<p>There are 116 highly-rated local duct cleaners. Indoor pollution sources that release gases or particles into the air are the main cause of indoor air quality issues in houses. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor contaminant levels by not bringing in sufficient outdoor air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air toxins out of the home. High temperature and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some contaminants.<p>
<p>The factor for keeping the heat source low is simple. Heat rises, so it makes good sense to locate the heat source at the floor level. This lets the heat naturally travel through the hot" zone, which is from an individual's toe to head location.
