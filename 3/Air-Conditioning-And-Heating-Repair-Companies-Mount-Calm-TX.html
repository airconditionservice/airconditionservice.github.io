<p>Sean was extremely helpful. He is a very enjoyable individual to deal with. No pressure applied to purchase additional stuff. Addressed all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put rise protectors on the unit and do the full maintenance on the unit. that was to make sure they were no problems other than the blower motor. Since there was not one on hand, the only reason he could not install the brand-new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he understands for sure what the issue is.<p>
<p>7 To check it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect next to the compressor and the main panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature below the room temperature level, and after that switch it ON. To avoid straining an a/c unit's compressor, wait at least 5 minutes in between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You need to hear the outdoor compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. Look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this) if the fan isn't turning.<p>
