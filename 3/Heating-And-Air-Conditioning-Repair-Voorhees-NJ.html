<p>My "C" ranking is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The system runs silently and effectively, but to have two major elements fail in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant dependability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (defrost control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were listed on the invoice before work started. Parts were covered by guarantee.

<p>I have actually been working in HVAC for over twenty years. Now I am starting my own HVAC company. I can inform you that it is a difficult job that the employees sweat and bleed at, especially residential service. When there is no work there is no pay. That is where PMs work, keeps us in touch with consumers and keeps guys working. When a sales man concerns your house he is there to sell, that is the only way he is paid. You have a good Tech PM your system, he is paying bills and should not "require" to offer you something you do not require. Your $1500 UV light is something you were offered on. For me, I give you the alternatives for your requirements and you choose if you require it.<p>
