<p>The function of most structure ventilation systems is to generate adequate fresh air for resident comfort while controlling temperature, humidity, and indoor air quality for personnel and constructing security at sensible energy costs. Load computing is referred to as the Handbook J estimation and ought to be performed by the HVAC contractor before providing an installation or unit cost for air conditioning.

As the hot water (or electrical power) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the flooring and into the space.<p>
