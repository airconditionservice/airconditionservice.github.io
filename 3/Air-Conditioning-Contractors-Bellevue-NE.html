<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't successful you wouldn't use them.. Secondly like extended car service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is actually unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the required skills to do the task and likewise the morals to deal with clients relatively. As a consumer you need to be well notified in order not to be completely benefited from. A lot of companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to correctly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to offer brand-new versus repair. Finally discovered someone to properly service and the system has been operating issue totally free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
