<p>In a common residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar earned to his staff members, devices costs, marketing, utilities, and other costs prior to paying himself anything. Normally this leaves about 6% of earnings to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This doesn't sound like much, specifically if the objective of owning a company was for financial freedom. Plus, this 6% wants the couple of years it required to construct the business and not taking an income as the owner. However, this 6% normally isn't the end goal. HVAC entrepreneur should strive for 10-15% by cutting costs in some locations or increasing their revenues while keeping expenses the very same in all other locations.<p>

<p>Current Review: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and educated. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
