<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't rewarding you wouldn't use them.. Secondly like extended car service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is truly sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the necessary skills to do the job and likewise the morals to treat consumers relatively.
