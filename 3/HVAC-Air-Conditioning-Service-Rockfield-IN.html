<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Well-kept heating devices can last for several years.

The collectors, piping and storage tank ought to be checked for leakages, the system must be flushed periodically to eliminate tank and gathered pollutants (scaling in hard water areas).
