<p>When setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external system to the internal ones, the main problem. While installing a separate split system, employees try to find both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Setting up a multi-split system produces more troubles, because some of indoor units can be located far from the outside. The first designs of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not permit you to set the air conditioning individually for each room. Nevertheless, now the marketplace has a broad selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional characteristics of indoor systems operate separately from each other.<p>
