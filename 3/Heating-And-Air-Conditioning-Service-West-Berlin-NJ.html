<p>4 Seasons has actually set up both of my heating systems and air conditioners, cleaned up the ducts and done the annual maintenance. I have found them to be reasonably priced, timely and do great work. When they installed my main furnace they worked out beyond what was necessary and redid the whole plenum and the duct work for the hot water heater due to the fact that the service technicians thought they simply didn't appear right and they couldn't leave them that way. No extra charge.<p>

<p>For every load of laundry you dry, that moisture has to go somewhere. If your dryer is vented to the garage or basement, you're just requesting mold buildup, states Dr. Khatri. Speaking of laundry, switching from fragranced to fragrance-free items can be a reliable and simple technique to lower ambient air pollution and prospective health dangers, according to a 2018 study in the journal Air Quality, Atmosphere & Health.<p>
<p>Individuals operating in buildings with poor IAQ may notice musty or undesirable odors or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about signs that occur at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more serious problem. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been connected to IAQ issues. If you have signs that are not going away or are getting worse, talk to your doctor about them. However not all exposures cause signs, so there is no substitute for great structure management.<p>
<p>Examples of non-friable asbestos items include vinyl asbestos flooring tiles, acoustic ceiling tiles, and asbestos cement products. These products provide a threat only when they are handled in a manner that creates dust consisting of asbestos fibers which can be inhaled. When asbestos-containing materials are harmed or disturbed by repair, redesigning, or demolition activities, tiny fibers can become airborne if proper controls are not in place. This can result in the capacity for substantial illness.<p>
