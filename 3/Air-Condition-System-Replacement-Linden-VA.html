<p>In a normal residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar made to his employees, devices costs, marketing, utilities, and other expenditures before paying himself anything. Normally this leaves about 6% of earnings to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This doesn't seem like much, especially if the objective of owning a company was for financial freedom. Plus, this 6% is after the couple of years it required to construct business and not taking an income as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% generally isn't the end objective. HVAC business owners need to strive for 10-15% by cutting costs in some locations or increasing their revenues while keeping costs the exact same in all other areas.<p>
