Closing off vents and signs up in unused rooms is NOT a great idea. You will not save any extra money and will wind up causing more problems for your heating system.<p>
<p>Before you head out and purchase an a/c, there are a couple of things to decide initially. Where are you going to be installing the ac system? If your house is not equipped with ductwork, do you wish to set up some or go ductless? How big should the air conditioning unit be? Too big and you'll encounter problems with short-cycling, which can harm the air conditioner and shorten its life. Too small and your ac system will not have the ability to cool your house correctly. These are just a few of the factors that you require to take into consideration when shopping for a new AC system. Each choice can and will significantly impact your system's performance, which is why you can't pay for to neglect any of them.<p>

However, assuming they are installed correctly and appropriately looked after, the likelihood of them having problems is small.<p>
