<p>In a common residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar made to his employees, equipment expenses, marketing, energies, and other costs prior to paying himself anything. Generally this leaves about 6% of revenues to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This does not seem like much, specifically if the goal of owning a company was for monetary liberty. Plus, this 6% is after the couple of years it required to build business and not taking an income as the owner. However, this 6% generally isn't completion objective. HVAC entrepreneur must strive for 10-15% by cutting costs in some areas or increasing their profits while keeping expenses the same in all other locations.<p>
