<p>Co2 concentrations increase as a result of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of co2 to quasi "constant state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based.

Portable instruments utilized to measure co2 ought to be adjusted often, and outdoor measurements utilized for calculations ought to be made close in time to indoor measurements.
