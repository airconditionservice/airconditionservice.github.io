The technician invested a good quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
