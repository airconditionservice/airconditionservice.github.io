<h3>HVAC Company in Dyke VA</h3>
<p>Recently, Target told press reporters at The Wall Street Journal and Reuters that the preliminary intrusion into its systems was traced back to network qualifications that were stolen from a third party supplier. Sources now tell KrebsOnSecurity that the vendor in question was a heating, air and refrigeration  conditioning subcontractor that has actually operated at a variety of locations at Target and other top sellers.<p>
<p>While these steps will help to keep your AC system in leading shape, know that there are maintenance products that just a trained HVAC technician will have the ability to do. For instance, a sluggish refrigerant leak in your AC system can result in costly compressor failure, but a homeowner does not have the tools or skills needed to check refrigerant levels. Likewise, tidy ducts and appropriate air flow are important to a well-functioning system, but house owners lack the essential devices for the job. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a savvy property owner, it's still essential to have an expert technician check the system periodically.<p>
