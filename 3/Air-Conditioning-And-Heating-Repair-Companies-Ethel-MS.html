<h3>AC Repair Cost in Ethel MS</h3>
<p>If you think a mold issue-- either due to the fact that of visible development or a moldy smell consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much great if it does not get rid of the mold. Mold begins with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can check and keep. Dripping return ducts can also introduce moisture. Again, if you suspect a mold problem, consider having a service company check the duct system for leaks.<p>

Your AC will not work totally unless you do this.<p>
