<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a need for air conditioning unit repair, which you ought to watch out for. Initially, you must examine your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little unreasonable, but ice on your ac system can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly if completely iced over.<p>
