<p>Called WSE for a routine assessment. The tech showed up right on time and was well-informed & friendly throughout the go to. They recommended replacing a couple of parts that were heading out. They weren't cheap but a fast web search confirmed WSE wasn't inflating rates, so I gladly had them replaced. However, a week later the furnace stopped working.

<h3>Solar Heating System in Holiday FL</h3>
<p>For a heated floor area less than 20 sq. ft., you could (in most cases) draw power from a nearby GFCI-protected outlet without overwhelming the circuit. (If the thermostat you acquire is currently GFCI secured like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad need to be GFCI safeguarded.) But a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can trigger overloads and nuisance breaker journeys. For our larger mat, we elected to set up a dedicated circuit with its own circuitry and circuit breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are available.<p>
<p>Oil heaters are usually not really efficient. They utilize less fuel than other furnace types, but most do not attain an effectiveness higher than 90%.

You pay more for the installation too because a drain requires to be set up.<p>
