<p>A blocked furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut down. Filthy filters are the most common cause of furnace issues. Dust and dirt limit air flow-- and if the filter gets too clogged, the heat exchanger will shut and overheat off too rapidly, and your house will not heat up. If the blower is running however no heat is coming out, change the filter. An unclean filter also triggers soot buildup on the heat exchanger, minimizing the effectiveness of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>

<p>I am very satisfied with this company. Among my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the problem within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call business several years earlier and know the significance of having the best parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also impressed that he showed up at my home at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be using Waycoff's once again, and would advise them to everyone. Thank You quite.<p>
