Send for the EPA handout, Lead and Your Drinking Water, to find out more about what you can do if you have actually lead in your drinking water.

<p>Keep in mind, too, that you might want to speak to a Seattle HVAC contractor, as different heat pump systems can have various heating and cooling capacities. If you already have a house heater, you might try to find a heatpump more geared toward cooling capability and effectiveness. For a higher-end design to look after your heating and cooling needs, you'll naturally wish to look for a design that will have enough heating for the cold Seattle winters. The bright side is that the one significant downside of heat pumps is that they can stop working in the cold or incredibly hot temperatures, which are nonexistent in the Puget Sound location.<p>
