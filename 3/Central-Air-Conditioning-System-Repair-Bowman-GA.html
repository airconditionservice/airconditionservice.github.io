<p>The majority of central air conditioners are connected to a house's forced-air circulation system. Thus, the exact same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are utilized to distribute cool air from the a/c system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is operating, hot air inside your home flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool the house. When the air conditioning unit works but the house does not cool, the issue is probably in the circulation system.<p>

<p>We included a new 1500 sf office to conduct our workshops and needed some heating. After calling Integrity we were offered an excellent quote on a glowing floor system. We remained in a time crunch for upcoming event, and Tyler came right out and had us connected in a number of days. The systems works wonderful and the new workplace feels really comfortable. It was a pleasure working with such an expert company and would highly advise them to anyone trying to find HVAC.<p>
<p>I am extremely pleased with this company. Among my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) identified the problem within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call company many years ago and understand the significance of having the best parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also satisfied that he appeared at my home at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be using Waycoff's once again, and would advise them to everybody. Thank You very much.<p>
