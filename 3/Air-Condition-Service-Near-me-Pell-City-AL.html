<p>My "C" ranking is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heat pump. The system runs quietly and effectively, however to have two significant parts fail in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor expenses (thaw control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were listed on the billing before work started. Parts were covered by warranty.

<p>7 To evaluate it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect beside the compressor and the primary panel.

<h3>Furnace Maintenance in Pell City AL</h3>
<p>I usually do not leave evaluations but wanted to share my experience. You don't anticipate needing to replace your AC system. Regrettably for us, we had no other option. What made me go with this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional discussing my alternatives. After organisation hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and talk about options. I arranged my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a household good friend and now I will advise this company to my good friends.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider since the two professionals I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>You most likely understand that not every HVAC contractor has the exact same focus, skillset, or experience when you start your search for an HVAC contractor in Columbus and surrounding suburban areas. 2 local HVAC companies may use two clearly different set of services, so it's an excellent idea to research study HVAC contractors and evaluate their sites, reviews and history before you call for service. By learning more about more about an HVAC service provider prior to you call, you'll understand whether they are the very best company to manage the service or problem you require them for.<p>
