(If the thermostat you buy is already GFCI protected like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad must be GFCI safeguarded.) But a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can trigger overloads and problem circuit breaker trips. For our larger mat, we elected to set up a devoted circuit with its own circuitry and circuit breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are offered.<p>
