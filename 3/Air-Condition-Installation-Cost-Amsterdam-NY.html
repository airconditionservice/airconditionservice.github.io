The heat exchanger had a really little bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'could' cause a problem in the future.

<p>Using a stove hood with a fan vented to the outdoors significantly minimizes direct exposure to pollutants during cooking. Incorrect modification, typically suggested by a persistent yellow-tipped flame, causes increased pollutant emissions. Ask your gas company to adjust the burner so that the flame idea is blue. If you purchase a brand-new gas range or range, consider buying one with pilotless ignition since it does not have a pilot light that burns constantly. Never ever use a gas range to heat your house. Constantly make sure the flue in your gas fireplace is open when the fireplace remains in use.<p>
