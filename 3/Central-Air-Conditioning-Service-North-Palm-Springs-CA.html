<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company since the two professionals I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
