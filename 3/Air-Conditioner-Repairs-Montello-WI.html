<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely utilized in dry cleaning. In laboratory research studies, it has actually been shown to trigger cancer in animals. Recent studies show that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned goods are stored and as they use dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning procedure so they can conserve cash by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical during the pressing and finishing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to lessen your direct exposure to this chemical is prudent. If dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical smell when you pick them up, do not accept them until they have been correctly dried. Attempt a different dry cleaner if products with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent visits.<p>
<p>A fair bit of research study enters into replacing or repairing a gas furnace such as choosing the best devices and selecting the best contractor for the job. Being extensive and doing your homework will increase the chances of a smooth furnace installation or repair. Utilize our helpful HVAC contractor checklist throughout your HVAC installation to make things simpler on you and your furnace repair person.<p>
<p>In some cases a short-lived indoor air quality issue is produced simply by a one-off, out-of-the-ordinary activity taking place inside a room or structure, such as an overcrowded conference location. In those cases, a short-term repair may be all that's needed, such as bringing or opening a window in a fan. But more complicated issues-- determined by consistently unacceptable air quality monitoring results-- will require a different tack. Depending upon the problem you're experiencing, one of the three strategies listed below may be appropriate.<p>
