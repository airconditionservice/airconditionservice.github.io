<p>In a common residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar made to his staff members, devices costs, marketing, energies, and other expenses prior to paying himself anything. Usually this leaves about 6% of incomes to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This does not sound like much, especially if the objective of owning a company was for financial freedom. Plus, this 6% is after the few years it required to develop the business and not taking an earnings as the owner. However, this 6% usually isn't the end goal. HVAC business owners must pursue 10-15% by cutting costs in some locations or increasing their earnings while keeping expenses the very same in all other areas.<p>

<p>The evaporator coil is probably frozen. The cause is normally an absence of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is brought on by a plugged filter. Without airflow, moisture from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC system, let the ice melt, change the filter, and try again.
