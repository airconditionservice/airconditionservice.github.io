While setting up a different split system, workers attempt to locate both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little.

Nevertheless, now the marketplace has a wide selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional characteristics of indoor systems run individually from each other.<p>

But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and wear and is quickly pierced.<p>
