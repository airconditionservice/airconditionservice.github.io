<p>For each load of laundry you dry, that moisture has to go somewhere. If your dryer is vented to the garage or basement, you're just requesting mold buildup, says Dr. Khatri. Mentioning laundry, switching from fragranced to fragrance-free items can be a simple and reliable  technique to reduce ambient air pollution and potential health risks, according to a 2018 research study in the journal Air Quality, Environment & Health.<p>
<p>Next, and perhaps just as essential when it concerns central air conditioning expenses, is the AC system's size. A system that is too large will have a simple time keeping the home cool, however will have a harder time removing humidity from the air. On the other hand, a system that is too small will not have the ability to appropriately cool the house on hot days. Thinking about larger systems cost more than smaller sized units, it pays to ask a local HVAC professional what size AC unit your central air conditioning system requires to hold.<p>
