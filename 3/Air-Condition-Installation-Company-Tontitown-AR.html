<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature level is regularly in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heatpump end up being ineffective in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice types on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system need to momentarily switch back into the regular a/c mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
