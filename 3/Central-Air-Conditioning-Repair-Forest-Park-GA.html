<p>Reality: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment typically lasts decades, since it is safeguarded inside. When it does require to be changed, the expense is much less than putting in an entire new geothermal system, given that the loop or well is the most costly to set up. New technical standards eliminate the problem of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely. In the past, some poorly sized systems did overcool the ground or get too hot over time, to the point that the system no longer had sufficient of a temperature gradient to function.<p>

Humidifier systems on HVAC systems also should be correctly preserved to prevent bacteria and mold contamination.<p>
