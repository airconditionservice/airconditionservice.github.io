<p>Volatile natural substances (VOCs)-- These are the primary factors to poor indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both indoors and outdoors. VOCs are organic chemicals produced as gases from processes or products; for the many part, you can smell their existence. Normal sources of VOCs inside your home include things like cleaning representatives, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more.

Sources of VOC contamination from outdoors might include unpredictable chemicals in polluted groundwater that are pulled inside during water use.<p>
<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Disease is triggered by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The primary route of exposure is through the production of an aerosol impact, the majority of frequently from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A common source of Legionella in commercial buildings is from inadequately positioned or maintained evaporative cooling towers, which often release water in an aerosol which may enter close-by ventilation consumption. Outbreaks in medical facilities and assisted living home, where patients are immuno-suppressed and immuno-weak, are the most commonly reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has involved outside fountains in public attractions. The existence of Legionella in commercial structure water supplies is highly under-reported, as healthy individuals require heavy exposure to acquire infection.<p>
