We understand about air contamination and acid rain, we can see smoke and odor exhaust, and we may even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck gush thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air contaminants are often 2 to 5 times greater than outside levels, and in some cases these levels can exceed 100 times that of outside levels of the exact same pollutants. To put it simply, often the air inside can be more hazardous than the air exterior.<p>
<p>A bioaerosol is an air-borne item of a biological pollutant. Biological impurities in the home may consist of mold, bacteria, infections, termites, and pollen.

They also can cause allergies, including hypersensitivity pneumonitis, hay fever, and some kinds of asthma. Signs triggered by biological contaminants include sneezing, eye inflammation, coughing, lightheadedness, and respiratory infections.<p>
