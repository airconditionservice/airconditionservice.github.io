<p>Appropriate ventilation assists enhance indoor air quality. It's easy to think that the air quality outside is worse than the air quality inside. We understand about air pollution and acid rain, we can see smoke and smell exhaust, and we may even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck spew thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air pollutants are frequently 2 to 5 times higher than outdoor levels, and sometimes these levels can go beyond 100 times that of outside levels of the very same toxins. In other words, in some cases the air inside can be more hazardous than the air outside.<p>

<h3>AC Replacement in Thiells NY</h3>
<p>IAQ can be affected by gases (consisting of carbon monoxide gas, radon, unstable natural substances ), particulates, microbial contaminants (mold, bacteria ), or any mass or energy stress factor that can induce adverse health conditions. Source control, filtration and the use of ventilation to water down contaminants are the main approaches for enhancing indoor air quality in many buildings. Residential units can even more enhance indoor air quality by regular cleaning of carpets and area rugs.<p>
<p>Air flow patterns in building are figured out by the combined forces of mechanical ventilation systems, human activity, and natural effects. Atmospheric pressure differences created by these forces move airborne contaminants from areas of greater pressure to locations of lower pressure through any available opening in structure walls, ceilings, floorings, doors, windows, and HVAC systems. Even if the opening is small, air will move up until the inside pressure is equal to the outside.<p>
