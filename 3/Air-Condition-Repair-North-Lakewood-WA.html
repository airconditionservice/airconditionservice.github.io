<h3>Gas Central Heating Systems in North Lakewood WA - The Benefits</h3>
<p>During winter season, the ground source heat is absorbed by pumping an anti-freeze and water-based  solution through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid circulates around this loop, transferring the absorbed heat to a refrigerant via the evaporator, altering it from a liquid to gas. From here it passes through the compressor, increasing the temperature of the gas as a direct outcome of the compression procedure. From here, the gas relocates to the condenser, which moves the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heater.<p>
