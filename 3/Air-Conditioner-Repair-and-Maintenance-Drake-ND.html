<p>Some health results may appear shortly after a single direct exposure or duplicated direct exposures to a toxin. These consist of irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, lightheadedness, and tiredness. Such instant results are usually short-term and treatable.

<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't rewarding you would not use them.  Second of all like prolonged vehicle guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is truly sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the essential skills to do the job and also the morals to deal with clients fairly. As a client you need to be well informed in order not to be entirely benefited from. Many companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to properly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell new versus repair. Lastly found someone to properly service and the unit has actually been operating problem complimentary for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
