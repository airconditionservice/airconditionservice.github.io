<p>These guys have actually been excellent. At a realtor, I often require contractors to provide me an opinion for what work on a home may cost. Just recently I required to contact these men twice. They came out rapidly and offered me a no nonsense quote for the work. Even when it was news my customer most likely wouldn't want to hear, they didn't sugar coat anything. I value the honesty. Integrity isn't just their name, it's a company design they take seriously. You guys are formally on speed dial. Talk to you quickly.<p>
<p>Individuals working in buildings with poor IAQ may see undesirable or moldy odors or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about symptoms that occur at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more serious issue. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ issues. If you have symptoms that are not disappearing or are worsening, speak to your doctor about them. But not all exposures cause signs, so there is no substitute for great structure management.<p>
