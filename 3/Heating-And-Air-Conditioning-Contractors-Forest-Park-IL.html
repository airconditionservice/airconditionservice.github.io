Modern 2- and three-stage heating systems increase efficiency even further by performing at lower or higher capacity depending on the heating requirements of the area.<p>

When the system is in use, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating aspects throughout the house. Heat radiates out from the heating components, through the flooring, and into the room. This is why the method is described as radiant heat.<p>
