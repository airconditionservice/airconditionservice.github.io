Pressed wood items made for indoor usage consist of: particleboard (used as subflooring and shelving and in cabinetry and furniture); hardwood plywood paneling (utilized for ornamental wall covering and used in cabinets and furnishings); and medium density fiberboard (utilized for drawer fronts, cabinets, and furnishings tops). Medium density fiberboard includes a higher resin-to-wood ratio than any other UF pushed wood item and is typically acknowledged as being the greatest formaldehyde-emitting pressed wood product.<p>
