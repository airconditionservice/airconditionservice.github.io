<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You ought to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have extremely little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the car debit, although my company does not use auto debit many companies do so they can have a known amount of money coming in each month, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year.
