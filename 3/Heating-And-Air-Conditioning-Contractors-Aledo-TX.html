<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, fairly steady in time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the frustrating majority of the mass of product in a structure as relatively unchanged physical product with time.

Buildings can be explained and understood as intricate systems. Research study applying the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the constructed environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
