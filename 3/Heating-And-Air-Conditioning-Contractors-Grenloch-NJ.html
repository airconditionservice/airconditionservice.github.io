<p>When filters aren't changed or cleaned routinely, they can end up being obstructed with particles that can limit airflow, potentially affecting your comfort and your system's effectiveness. Unclean filters can cause additional wear and tear on furnace parts and in more extreme cases trigger the system to shut down completely. By comparison, replacing a furnace and checking filter can typically be done in simply a few minutes, typically with no tools required. As a safety measure, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, make sure to switch off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, typically mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>

<p>Direct Exposure Control: Adjusting the time and location of toxin direct exposure. An example of time control is scheduling floor waxing and stripping (with the ventilation system working) on a Friday. This enables products to off-gas over the weekend while most of the staff are at home over the weekend. Place control involves moving the toxin source away from occupants or even moving vulnerable residents.<p>
<p>In a location where temperatures reach freezing, air-source heat pumps make good primary heating systems. You'll wish to have a backup system installed, such as a gas furnace, which can take over when temperatures reach freezing.

The controls will require the furnace to come on, efficiently heating the home in these conditions.<p>

If the market for that energy source turns unstable, rates can vary, prices increase and you can wind up paying more to heat your home no matter how low you set your thermostat.<p>
