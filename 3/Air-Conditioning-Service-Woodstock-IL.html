<p>A geothermal heating system does not produce its power by burning nonrenewable fuel sources such as coal, gas, or oil. Instead, it soaks up heat from within the earth. In addition, a geothermal heating and cooling system uses substantially less electricity compared to a basic electric heat-resistance heat pump. This makes a geothermal heater an appealing option to cut your carbon footprint, providing a positive effect on the environment.<p>
<p>In addition, homeowners have a range of alternatives to pick from in powering a floor heater. Radiant systems are compatible with electrical, natural gas, even geothermal and solar energy sources. As numerous house owners are all too conscious, tradition furnace systems are usually restricted to working on a single energy source, such as heating oil. If the market for that energy source turns volatile, rates can fluctuate, rates surge and you can wind up paying more to heat your home no matter how low you set your thermostat.<p>
