<p>Lots of individuals are becoming more aware and worried about their health and the impact of indoor air quality. Dust and dirt consisting of contaminants and allergens can cover the a/c ductwork with time. Periodically it must be removed to improve and refresh the quality of indoor air and enhance the cooling.
