<p>Immediate results may show up after a single exposure or duplicated exposures. These consist of inflammation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, lightheadedness, and tiredness. Such immediate results are typically short-term and treatable. Sometimes the treatment is simply getting rid of the person's direct exposure to the source of the pollution, if it can be identified. Symptoms of some illness, consisting of asthma, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and humidifier fever, might also show up soon after exposure to some indoor air toxins.<p>
<p>Irritants are products that trigger an immune-type response in people who are sensitized to these products. Irritants found in indoor air are primarily biological material such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect pest particles, pollen, germs, and mold. All of these materials are small particles, can become airborne, and hence, are quickly breathed in. Irritants that are inhaled by sensitized people with asthma can trigger asthma attacks. For instance, if you consider a group of people with asthma, the presence of cat irritant might induce an asthma attack in people with feline allergic reactions, but not in those people who do not have feline allergic reactions.<p>

And almost 20 percent still smoke in your home or let others smoke there. All of those things can get worse indoor air quality.<p>
