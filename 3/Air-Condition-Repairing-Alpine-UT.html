For instance, house owners may want to look for one that comes with a built-in filter light that will alert you when the air filter needs to be changed.

The heat exchanger permits air to be heated up without coming in contact with the actual flame or burner area. Once it reaches an adequate temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the home's duct, supplying warm air to individual bedrooms, living rooms and kitchen areas through the vents or registers.<p>
