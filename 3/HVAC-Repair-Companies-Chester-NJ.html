<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently gets requests for consultation and assistance in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal companies. During the 1970s, many house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation procedure. Nevertheless, much of these houses were discovered to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Couple of homes are now being insulated with this product. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was set up several years back are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts include the advancement and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality designs, particularly the CONTAM series which predicts air flows and pollutant concentrations in multizone structure systems. CONTAM is based on a graphic user interface that allows the user to draw floor plans on a "sketchpad" and utilize "icons" to represent airflow paths, ventilation system components, and pollutant sources. CONTAM has been utilized at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transportation in large residential, workplace, and school structures.<p>
