<h3>Central Heating System in Stow OH</h3>
<p>My house has 5 units, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" discovered something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned up for an additional $30.00. (He literally stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I grumbled and got a refund) When this man belittled me for my "not understanding", I tossed him off the residential or commercial property.<p>

<h3>Working of an HVAC System in Stow OH</h3>
<p>Stability Energy Systems (IES) called us through the CPW program to bid on numerous home efficiency upgrades (furnace, hot water heater, insulation and sealing.)

Taylor helped us narrow the scope to a reasonable level, a heat pump replacement for our oil furnace, while allowing me to perform the essential electrical improvements to save on cost.<p>
