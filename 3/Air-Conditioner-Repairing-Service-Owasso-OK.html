<p>There is a transformer in your a/c furnace. The transformer is what materials 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. Your Nest will not come on if your transformer breakdowns. Your transformer transforms the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends power to your typical wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency safety changes that secure your a/c system from flooding. Among the most common places for emergency ac repair midtown Tx safety switches is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. If your Nest is revealing a blank screen, it is a likelihood; you may have a water leak in the attic. The water triggers your emergency safety switch, thus cutting power to your HVAC transformer.
