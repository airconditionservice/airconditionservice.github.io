<p>A lot of central air conditioners are connected to a house's forced-air circulation system. Hence, the exact same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are utilized to disperse cool air from the air conditioning system. When a central air conditioner is operating, hot air inside your house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your home. When the a/c works but the house does not cool, the problem is probably in the circulation system.<p>
