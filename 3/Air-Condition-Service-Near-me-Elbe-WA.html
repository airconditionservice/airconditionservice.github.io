<h3>The History of Air Source Heat Pumps at Elbe WA</h3>
<p>In-floor heating systems can feature specific health advantages. The hotter the air, the drier it ends up being. On those days when you simply can't seem to heat up and discover you need to turn up your thermostat, your furnace can draw all the humidity out of your home and leave your sinuses throbbing. In-floor heating systems are not vulnerable to this concern since they heat surfaces and not the air itself. Additionally, because they do not trust fans, ducts, signs up and returns to distribute hot air, in-floor heater can lower the amount of dust and seasonal allergens in your home.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outside air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the demand to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
