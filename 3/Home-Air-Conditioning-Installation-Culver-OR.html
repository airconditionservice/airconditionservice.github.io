<p>It is common to assume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady in time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a structure as fairly unchanged physical product over time. In fact, the real nature of buildings can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be explained and comprehended as intricate systems. Research study using the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the developed environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
