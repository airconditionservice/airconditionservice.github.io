<p>How environment modification impacts air quality and direct exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature (which is a basic mode of operation for modern-day air conditioners) requires that the rate of energy elimination by the air conditioning system increase. This increase has the effect that, for each system of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the ac system eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioning system should increase its power intake by the inverse of its "efficiency" (coefficient of performance) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is activated, and the a/c has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The air conditioner's power consumption will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, hence making the 100 W heating element cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
