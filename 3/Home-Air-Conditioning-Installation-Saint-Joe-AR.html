Mold begins with a wetness problem, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can examine and maintain.

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have extremely little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the automobile debit, although my company does not offer vehicle debit numerous companies do so they can have a known quantity of cash coming in monthly, it aids with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. , if we do decide to use auto debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.. There must not be any reason why your company can not provide this. Hope this helps.<p>
