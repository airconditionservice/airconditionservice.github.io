<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the 2 technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
