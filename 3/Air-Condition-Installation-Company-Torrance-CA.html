<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly used in dry cleaning. In laboratory studies, it has been shown to cause cancer in animals. Current research studies indicate that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned items are kept and as they use dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can save money by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical during the pushing and finishing processes.
