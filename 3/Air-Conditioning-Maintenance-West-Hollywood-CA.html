<p>When installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones, the primary problem.

The very first designs of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not allow you to set the air conditioning separately for each space. Nevertheless, now the marketplace has a large selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional attributes of indoor systems operate individually from each other.<p>
