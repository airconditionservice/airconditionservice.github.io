<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider since the two technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
