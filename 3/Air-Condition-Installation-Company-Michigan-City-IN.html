<h3>HVAC Repairman Near Me in Michigan City IN</h3>
<p>Some a/c systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heatpump, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise typically referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioning unit". The heat pump is substantially more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, in addition to the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit also switches functions to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
