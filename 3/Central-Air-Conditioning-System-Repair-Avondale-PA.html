<p>Luis was immediately responsive to email and texts with concerns. He devoted to the job based just on emails, appeared and provided with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, installed on Wednesday). Protexs deal was among the few reasonable ones received. Others were nearly twice the quantity Protex estimated for low end off brand name devices. I got Carrier. ProTex correctly advised me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser despite the fact that it would have made them more cash (Sincerity) The set up group was respectful of my home and installed the devices in the anticipated amount of time. post install assessment outcomes look great for braising and plumbing quality. New system cools much better than the 13 year old 4 ton R22 unit it changed (also Provider).<p>
<p>Four Seasons has set up both of my heating systems and air conditioners, cleaned the ducts and done the yearly maintenance. I have found them to be reasonably priced, timely and do fine work. When they installed my primary furnace they worked out beyond what was essential and redid the whole plenum and the duct work for the hot water heater because the service technicians thought they just didn't seem right and they could not leave them that method. No extra charge.<p>
