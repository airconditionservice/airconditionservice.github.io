<p>A packaged unit, generally installed on the roofing, is most typically used on commercial structures, however it is also an option for house owners to consider. Oftentimes, these systems include not only the air conditioning unit itself but likewise a furnace. A benefit of this unit is definitely the cost. Packaged systems are excellent for those aiming to conserve money on the installation of a brand-new heating and cooling system independently, because the unit is integrated. However, one con is that these systems are typically only available for larger homes due to their high power and capability. In addition, while they can be a good way to conserve cash on a total HVAC system, they're still substantially more costly than purchasing simply a cooling system. For that reason, this may not be the very best option for homeowners trying to find short-term savings or those with smaller budget plans.<p>
