<p>Called WSE for a routine examination. The tech appeared right on time and was friendly & well-informed throughout the visit. They recommended replacing a couple of parts that were heading out.

I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in exact same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they set up the week prior was malfunctioning.
