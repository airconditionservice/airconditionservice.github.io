A crucial part of the program is responding to and resolving concerns of building residents about problems in their work environment.<p>
<p>Frequently, indoor air quality problems in large commercial buildings can not be effectively determined or treated without a detailed structure examination.

Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay may have welded together-- something that can happen in time because of frequent electrical arcing at the relay.
