<p>Examine these 3 things initially if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make sure all the registers in the house are broad open. Then be sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outdoors and tidy off the condenser coils (Photo 2). The lowered air flow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if numerous registers were closed or the filter was obstructed. Deice the A-coil if you have actually changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or up until there's great air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to test it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually solved the issue.<p>
