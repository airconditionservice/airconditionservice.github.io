<p>RMI is working to change that, starting in California. As a primary step, in April RMI affirmed prior to the California Air Resources Board, asking the agency to set stronger indoor guidelines based on the most recent science for NO2. The state of California has the authority to regulate indoor devices through codes, and after more powerful standards are set there is an opportunity to deal with enforcement.<p>
<p>For each load of laundry you dry, that moisture needs to go somewhere. If your dryer is vented to the garage or basement, you're just asking for mold buildup, states Dr. Khatri. Mentioning laundry, switching from fragranced to fragrance-free items can be a efficient and uncomplicated technique to reduce ambient air pollution and prospective health risks, according to a 2018 study in the journal Air Quality, Environment & Health.<p>
<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Discovered both within and outside, particulate matter is a mix of liquid droplets and strong particles suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, pollen, and soot. The particles themselves are different sizes, however the ones to be most worried about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller-- since they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outside PM, created by construction, for example, or the burning of fossil fuels, participates in structures via mechanical and natural ventilation. Inside it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Indoor pollution sources that release gases or particles into the air are the primary cause of indoor air quality problems. Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor toxin levels by not bringing in enough outside air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air toxins out of the location. High temperature and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some toxins.<p>
