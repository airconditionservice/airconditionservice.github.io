<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the demand to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (generally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly performed in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
