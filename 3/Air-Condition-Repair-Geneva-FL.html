<h3>Energy Efficient Heaters in Geneva FL</h3>
<p>I have been using them for years for my businesses, my own homes and my realty customers' houses. I went through five other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All five other companies quoted me with different costs and various issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth individual, who discussed to me thoroughly the concerns which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC stopped working at my rental house. He helped me difficulty shoot the issue when I called and he advised me to call guarantee which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the system working again. He is honest, reputable, and sensible on rate. It's tough to discover an honest AC man and I'm delighted I discovered Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>

He made a few suggestions of some maintenance tasks we might wish to have actually done in the future, but without the high pressure up-sale strategies employed by some in the market.<p>
