<p>Aerating or ventilation (the "V" in HVAC) is the process of exchanging or replacing air in any area to provide high indoor air quality which includes temperature control, oxygen replenishment, and elimination of moisture, odors, smoke, heat, dust, airborne germs, co2, and other gases.

If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, since something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
