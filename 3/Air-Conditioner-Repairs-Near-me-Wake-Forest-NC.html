<p>The rest of the HVAC system likewise requires to be in leading condition for the ac system to work well. This includes the air handler, evaporator coil, ductwork and signs up, all of which live inside the home.

Sealing leakages in ductwork can improve HVAC effectiveness by as much as 30 percent, and provide for a cooler house in the hot summer.<p>

Now the "difficult part" once a year shut off the electrical energy open the furnace and extremely carefully vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, do not touch the components, close up the cabinet put back on the electrical power. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
