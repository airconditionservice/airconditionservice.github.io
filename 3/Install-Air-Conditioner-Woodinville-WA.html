<p>Instead of incorporating to the ducts in your house, a mini-split heatpump has an indoor head system that mounts on a wall. A ductless system has an integrated performance advantage because up to 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC system may be lost to leakages in your ducts. Because they don't need any brand-new ductwork to be installed, ductless heat pumps are fantastic for additions. Since an unit is installed in each room or area you wish to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature level of each zone, which can conserve energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensors that instantly raise the temperature level in the room when you exist.<p>
