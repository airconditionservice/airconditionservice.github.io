Switched to using Wachoff's about a year earlier and they've been to the house for a system tune-up three times now. They're priced fairly, have handled the one repair I needed well, and are professional and constantly on-time. Have actually been through a couple of companies over the years and Wachoff's is definitely the very best I've had the chance to work with and Jesse, my technician 2 of 3 of those times, has been fantastic.<p>
<p>There are lots of things to consider when attempting to find out how typically I need to change my a/c filters. Every Houston Heights 77007 77008 house has an unique DNA on how it accumulates dust and dirt. It takes about 6 months of close observation to see how typically your air conditioning filter gathers dirt and dust. After that, you can make a better right choice on how frequently your HVAC filters require changing. Some Houston Midtown 77003 77004 homes have more than one HVAC filter, like townhouses. The more air filters you have in your Houston Galleria 77055 77056 77057 house, the less often you'll need to clean them. Houston Montrose 77006 77098 homes with just one cooling filter require changing more frequently.<p>
