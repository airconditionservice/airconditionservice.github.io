<h3>Efficient Heating and Air Conditioning Requires Proper Duct Sealing in Morgan Hill CA</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was great and on time. Josh was really clear and fast about his inspection, ensuring I comprehended what was looked out. My only negative is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So maybe a little steep on price for this service, but the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>
<p>The bottom line is to safeguard your financial investment by only utilizing the services of a certified contractor or a certified agent from a service or retailer to do the installation. If you select to try to do it yourself, or hire a non-licensed person to do the work, in many, if not all cases, you will void the service warranty for the a/c system. A voided warranty will not do you any good should the system fail or malfunction. Do it right from the get-go and hire a licensed individual with the experience to install the system.<p>
