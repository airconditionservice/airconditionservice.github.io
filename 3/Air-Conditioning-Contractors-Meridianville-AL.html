<h3>Factors to Consider When Looking for a Good AC Repair Company at Meridianville AL</h3>
<p>The majority of residential heating, ventilation, and cooling (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The present trend in home construction is to minimize air leakage through fractures and other openings in roofings, walls, and floorings. The mix of these building and construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has actually caused a boost in indoor air issues. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) suggests that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor cosmetics air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living areas of residential structures. The ASHRAE standards for make-up air for bathroom and kitchens in houses are much higher. This fresh make-up air assists and dilutes indoor pollutants tire them from the house.<p>
<p>Since an ac system moves heat in between the outside coil and the indoor coil, both should be kept tidy. This implies that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also needed to routinely clean up the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser tidy will ultimately result in harm to the compressor, because the condenser coil is responsible for releasing both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat generated by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
