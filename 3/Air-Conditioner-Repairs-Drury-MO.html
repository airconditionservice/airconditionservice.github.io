As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is activated, and the air conditioner has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioner's power consumption will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, thus making the 100 W heating component cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
