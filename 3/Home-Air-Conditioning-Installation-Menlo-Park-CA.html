<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively used in dry cleaning. In laboratory studies, it has actually been revealed to trigger cancer in animals. Recent research studies show that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned products are stored and as they wear dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can conserve cash by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical during the pressing and finishing procedures.
