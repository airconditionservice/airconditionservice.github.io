<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely used in dry cleaning. In lab research studies, it has been revealed to cause cancer in animals. Recent research studies show that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned products are kept and as they wear dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning procedure so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical throughout the pushing and ending up processes.
