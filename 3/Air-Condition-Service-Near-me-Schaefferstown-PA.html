Radiant heat systems have been around since the days of the Romans when they laid a network of pipelines under their marble floors and connected them into a hot water supply.

<p>The first air conditioning unit and fridges utilized hazardous or combustible gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or propane, that could lead to fatal mishaps when they dripped.

The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number showing the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A).
