<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may believe. Due to the fact that many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a little, low-cost flexible hose pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to tear and use and is quickly punctured.<p>
<p>Terrific service within 24 hours and a fair cost. The technician (Camryn) was really extensive and on-time in explaining what services would be performed.

He made a couple of recommendations of some maintenance tasks we may want to have performed in the future, however without the high pressure up-sale methods used by some in the industry.<p>
