<p>Due to the fact that it has to run longer than a correctly sized unit, an undersize system won't be able to cool spaces down totally on the hottest days and will cost more to operate.

That's since it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts off prior to it has an opportunity to distribute the correct volume of air past the coils to extract the required moisture.
