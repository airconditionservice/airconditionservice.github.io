<h3>Ductless Heating And Cooling in El Verano CA</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you might think. Since many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, affordable versatile hose pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to tear and use and is easily punctured.<p>
