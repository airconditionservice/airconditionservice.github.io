<h3>Furnace Maintenance  in New Prague MN</h3>
<p>There are many sources of indoor air contamination in any home. These consist of combustion sources such as oil, gas, kerosene, tobacco, wood, and coal items; structure products and furnishings as diverse as shabby, asbestos-containing insulation, wet or damp carpet, and kitchen cabinetry or furniture made from particular pushed wood products; items for home cleaning and maintenance, individual care, or pastimes; central heating and cooling systems and humidification gadgets; and outside sources such as radon, pesticides, and outdoor air contamination.<p>
