According to the EPA, nevertheless, the levels of indoor air toxins are often 2 to 5 times greater than outdoor levels, and in some cases these levels can surpass 100 times that of outside levels of the very same pollutants. In other words, in some cases the air inside can be more hazardous than the air outside.<p>
<p>The term radiant heat covers a couple of various system types. Most common are boilers, which are called hydronic radiant heat systems, and electric systems, which are typically referred to as just glowing systems. Electric radiant heat systems have heating aspects installed in the subfloor of each space in the home, periodically connected to terminal systems like baseboard heaters.
