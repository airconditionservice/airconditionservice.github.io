<p>WE ARE ALSO OFFERING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL COMFORT CONSULTATIONS. Bypass valve: Run a pipeline between the water pipe getting in and the water pipe leaving the traditional water heater. Set up a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the standard water heater are open, water will stream from the solar tank to the conventional water heater (typical operation). If the valves on the pipes entering and the pipes leaving the standard hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar tank past the conventional water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summer season when water temperatures are high, and the standard water heater can be turned off entirely.<p>
<p>The main problem when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external system to the internal ones. While setting up a separate split system, employees attempt to locate both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Setting up a multi-split system develops more difficulties, since some of indoor systems can be situated far from the exterior. The very first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not permit you to set the air conditioning individually for each space. Nevertheless, now the marketplace has a broad choice of multi-split systems, in which the functional characteristics of indoor units run independently from each other.<p>
