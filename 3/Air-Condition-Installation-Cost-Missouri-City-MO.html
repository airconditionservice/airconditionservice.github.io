<p>Homeowners might likewise presume that due to the fact that a radiant floor heating system can be viewed (and financed) as a home enhancement, its installation will immediately raise their home's value. No proof exists recommending that in-floor heating either favorably or negatively impacts home worths. In-floor heating is not even tracked in the yearly Cost vs. Value Report released by Hanley Wood Media, publishers of Remodeling Publication. Perhaps Realtors need to think about too many variables to definitively state what a radiant heating system may add to, or subtract from, any given asking rate. That said, property buyers looking to go green," who prioritize energy savings, or who definitely desire an in-floor heater will be willing to pay a premium for a home that includes one.<p>
