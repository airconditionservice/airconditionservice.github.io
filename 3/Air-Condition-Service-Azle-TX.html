<p>I have been utilizing them for several years for my companies, my own houses and my realty clients' houses. I went through 5 other companies before I found Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All 5 other companies quoted me with various costs and various issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th individual, who described to me thoroughly the problems which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC stopped working at my rental house. He assisted me problem shoot the problem when I called and he advised me to contact warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the system working once again. He is truthful, reliable, and sensible on cost. It's difficult to find a sincere AC guy and I'm thankful I found Luis. Highly suggest Luis and his company.<p>

There is proof that high concentrations or continued exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the threat of breathing infection; there is also evidence from animal research studies that repeated direct exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the development of lung illness such as emphysema.
