<p>When installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones, the main issue. While installing a separate split system, workers attempt to locate both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little.

The first designs of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not allow you to set the air conditioning separately for each room. Nevertheless, now the market has a broad choice of multi-split systems, in which the functional attributes of indoor systems operate individually from each other.<p>
