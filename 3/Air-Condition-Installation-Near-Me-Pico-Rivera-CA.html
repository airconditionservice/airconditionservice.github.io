<p>7 To test it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect beside the compressor and the primary panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature below the space temperature level, and after that switch it ON. To avoid straining an air conditioner's compressor, wait at least five minutes in between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You need to hear the outdoor compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. Look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this) if the fan isn't turning.<p>

<p>Start by raising the lower sash, and after that measure the height and width of the opening. Make sure to have those dimensions on hand when buying an air conditioning system to guarantee it'll fit conveniently into the window. Also, keep fire safety in mind when deciding where to set up the air conditioning system: Do not place it in an egress window that functions as the only ways of escape must a fire erupt.<p>
<p>Individuals operating in buildings with bad IAQ might notice moldy or undesirable smells or may feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about symptoms that take place at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more serious issue. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been connected to IAQ issues. Talk to your doctor about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting worse. However not all direct exposures trigger signs, so there is no replacement for good building management.<p>
<p>Biological contaminants include germs, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and cat saliva, home dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these toxins. Pollens originate from plants; infections are transferred by individuals and animals; germs are carried by individuals, animals, and soil and plant debris; and family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a powerful allergen. It can become air-borne when it dries. Polluted central air conditioning handling systems can end up being reproducing grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological impurities and can then distribute these impurities through the home.<p>
