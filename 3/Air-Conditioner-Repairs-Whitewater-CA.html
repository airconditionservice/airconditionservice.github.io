<p>Correct ventilation helps improve indoor air quality. It's easy to think that the air quality outside is even worse than the air quality inside. We understand about air pollution and acid rain, we can see smoke and smell exhaust, and we might even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck spew thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air toxins are typically 2 to 5 times greater than outdoor levels, and in some cases these levels can go beyond 100 times that of outside levels of the very same pollutants. In other words, sometimes the air inside can be more hazardous than the air exterior.<p>

Newer gas boilers must accomplish 80 percent AFUE and more recent fossil-fueled boilers must achieve a 75 percent AFUE.<p>
