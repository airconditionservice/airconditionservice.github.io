<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the two technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Through regular use and the system's presence outside, the coils and fins of the ac system may become very dirty. These elements of the devices are vital for efficient air conditioning.
