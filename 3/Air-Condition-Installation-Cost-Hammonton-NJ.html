<p>Free cooling systems can have very high performances, and are often integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summer cooling. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heatpump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in due to the fact that the storage acts as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (rather than charging) mode, triggering the temperature to slowly increase during the cooling season.<p>
