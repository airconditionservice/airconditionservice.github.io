<p>Indoor temperature levels are in some cases more tough to manage than they appear due to aspects such as heat gains from sunlight, outdoor conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE recommends temperatures ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer season; indoor relative humidity needs to be kept at or below 65%.

Infected central air handling systems can become reproducing premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological contaminants and can then disperse these contaminants through the house.<p>
