<p>AC units and thermostats have integrated hold-up functions when they're closed down and then repowered. The hold-up can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you have actually subscribed to an energy-saving gadget from your local power utility, the system can take even longer to reset. If you've set up the parts revealed and reinstalled the disconnect block, repowered the circuit breaker, turned on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and reduced the temperature listed below the indoor temperature, and the system does not fire up after thirty minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
