<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Properly maintained heating devices can last for years. But if you're experiencing regular breakdowns or your fuel bills unexpectedly appear higher than normal, it is probably time to consider a new system. New heating equipment is far more efficient-- you'll see lower fuel bills right now, not to mention the cash you'll save money on repair expenses. You can probably expect to cut your fuel costs in half if your heating system is 25 years old or more.<p>

<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â Most furnaces have numerous control boards. The biggest, or only one in some heating systems, is often called the Motherboard. The circuit boards manage and collaborate the operation of the motors, sensing units, ignitor, gas valve and more. Do It Yourself repair is possible, however the brand-new control board must be set up exactly right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work.
