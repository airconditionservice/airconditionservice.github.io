<h3>Heating System Repair in Wadsworth IL</h3>
<p>The federal government recommends that homes be weatherized in order to lower the amount of energy needed for heating & cooling. While weatherization is underway, however, steps must also be required to decrease pollution from sources inside the house. (See "Improving the Air Quality in your house" for recommended actions.) In addition, homeowners should be alert to the emergence of signs of insufficient ventilation, such as stuffy air, wetness condensation on cold surfaces, or mold and mildew growth. Additional weatherization measures need to not be carried out until these problems have been corrected.<p>

<p>Unpredictable natural compounds (VOCs)-- These are the main contributors to bad indoor air quality; they are common both inside and outdoors. VOCs are natural chemicals emitted as gases from processes or items; for the most part, you can smell their existence. Common sources of VOCs indoors include things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as relatively innocuous as a new carpet is most likely to be giving off formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outdoors could include volatile chemicals in contaminated groundwater that are pulled within during water usage.<p>
