<p>Co2 (CO2) is a reasonably easy to measure surrogate for indoor contaminants given off by humans, and associates with human metabolic activity. Co2 at levels that are uncommonly high inside may cause residents to grow drowsy, to get headaches, or to function at lower activity levels. Outside CO2 levels are normally 350-450 ppm whereas the optimum indoor CO2 level considered appropriate is 1000 ppm. 28 Humans are the main indoor source of co2 in the majority of structures. Indoor CO2 levels are a sign of the adequacy of outside air ventilation relative to indoor resident density and metabolic activity.<p>
<p>Lots of elements affect IAQ. These aspects include poor ventilation (absence of outside air), problems managing temperature, low or high humidity, current improvement, and other activities in or near a building that can impact the fresh air entering the structure. Often, specific impurities like dust from construction or restoration, mold, cleaning materials, pesticides, or other airborne chemicals (including small amounts of chemicals released as a gas with time) might trigger poor IAQ.<p>
