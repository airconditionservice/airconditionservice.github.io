<p>Energy efficiency can be improved a lot more in central heating systems by presenting zoned heating. This enables a more granular application of heat, similar to non-central heater.

<p>Co2 concentrations increase as an outcome of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of carbon dioxide to quasi "consistent state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. For that reason, measurements of carbon dioxide for purposes of assessing the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged duration of steady occupancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in workplaces at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to measure carbon dioxide should be adjusted often, and outdoor measurements used for calculations ought to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature results on measurements made outdoors may likewise be needed.<p>
<p>Volatile organic compounds (VOCs)-- These are the primary contributors to poor indoor air quality; they are common both inside and outdoors.

(Even something as apparently innocuous as a new carpet is most likely to be releasing formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outside could consist of unstable chemicals in contaminated groundwater that are pulled inside during water use.<p>
