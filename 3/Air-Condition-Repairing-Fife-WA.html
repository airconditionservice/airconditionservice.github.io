Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
