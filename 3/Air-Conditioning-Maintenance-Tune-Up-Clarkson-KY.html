<h3>Commercial HVAC in Clarkson KY</h3>
<p>We called Elite HEATING AND COOLING on one of the most popular days of summer( we had no central air for 2weeks) and they sent out some1 out exact same day to assess situation & chose to choose them for the work. I enjoy to say that not only did we get the central air going but also changed the heating system which was old. Everybody we talked with from beginning to end were really expert, considerate and the work was very efficiently done. I would highly advise this company.<p>
<p>In addition, employee health signs such as colds, headaches, sleepiness, irritation, and irregular breathing may be induced as the outcome of temperature level extremes, incorrect humidity levels, and insufficient or too much air blood circulation. Workplace temperatures ought to be preserved between 68 degrees- 75 degrees Fahrenheit and humidity levels in between 30%- 60%. In addition, drafts brought on by too much air flow must be avoided.<p>
<p>If the AC doesn't switch off, it might be time to clean the condensing uni t Dirty condenser coils will not release heat effectively and will keep the system running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay may have bonded together-- something that can take place over time since of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Before examining the run relay, switch off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, dismantle the relay and pry apart the contacts. This must do the trick till you buy a replacement-- which you must do quickly.<p>
