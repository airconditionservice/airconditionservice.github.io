<p>Today, countless dust mites, dead skin cells, building debris, and mold might be residing in your home's duct, impacting the air you breathe as well as the efficiency of your heating and air conditioning system. Indoor air quality isn't on most people's radar. Just 9 percent of Americans consider it a danger to their health, and 70 percent aren't worried about it at all, according to a recent survey by the Consumer Reports National Research Center.

Soil by roads and highways might be polluted from years of exhaust fumes from vehicles and trucks that utilized leaded gas. Use door mats to clean your feet before going into the house. Change your clothing before you go home and wash these clothing separately if you work with lead in your job or a hobby.

Try to keep your kids from consuming dirt, and make certain they clean their hands when they come inside.<p>
