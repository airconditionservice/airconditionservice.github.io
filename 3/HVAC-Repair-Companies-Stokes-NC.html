<p>We are OPEN as an "Essential Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds astounding, but furnace professionals often discover that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be turned on. Search for a standard wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Examine the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be totally depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>When attempting to figure out how typically I need to replace my air conditioning filters, there are lots of things to take into consideration. Every Houston Heights 77007 77008 house has a distinct DNA on how it accumulates dust and dirt.

After that, you can make a much better ideal choice on how typically your HVAC filters require replacing. Some Houston Midtown 77003 77004 homes have more than one HVAC filter, like townhouses. The more air filters you have in your Houston Galleria 77055 77056 77057 house, the less frequently you'll need to clean them. Houston Montrose 77006 77098 houses with just one cooling filter need changing more frequently.<p>

When examining your air conditioning devices to turn off all main power from the emergency breaker panel or disconnect switch, constantly make sure.
