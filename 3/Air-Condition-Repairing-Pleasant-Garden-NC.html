<p>EER means Energy Effectiveness Ratio. The energy effectiveness of central air conditioning units is measured by the variety of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set variety of conditions. As pointed out above, a BTU is a standard unit of heat; it is defined as the quantity of heat needed to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The common set conditions are outside temps of 95 ° F and an indoor temperature of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why many people don't utilize this measurement much anymore.<p>
<p>3. Gas Furnaces While the cost of heating your house with a gas furnace is usually higher than lots of heat pump alternatives, they can still be highly effective, depending upon the model you acquire. One of the main benefits of gas heating is that due to the combustion procedure, it will heat the air to greater temperatures than other heating alternatives.

<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a need for a/c unit repair, which you need to watch out for. First, you need to examine your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little unreasonable, however ice on your air conditioning unit can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
