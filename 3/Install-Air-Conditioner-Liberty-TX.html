<p>We are OPEN as an "Important Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds astounding, however furnace service technicians typically find that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be switched on. Look for a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Inspect the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is safely fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be completely depressed for the furnace to run.<p>

<h3>How to Get Your HVAC Certification and HVAC Licensing at Liberty TX</h3>
<p>Sean was extremely useful. He is a really pleasant individual to work with. No pressure used to buy additional stuff. Addressed all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put rise protectors on the system and do the full maintenance on the system. that was to make sure they were no problems besides the blower motor. The only reason he could not set up the brand-new blower motor was since there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he knows for sure what the issue is.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is usually an absence of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without airflow, wetness from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC unit, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and try once again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, because something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
