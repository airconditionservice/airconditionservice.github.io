<h3>Ductless AC System in Gretna FL</h3>
<p>I have been using them for several years for my organisations, my own homes and my property customers' homes. I went through five other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All five other companies quoted me with different costs and various problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth individual, who explained to me completely the concerns which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC quit working at my rental house. He helped me difficulty shoot the concern when I called and he recommended me to contact service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the unit working again. He is sincere, dependable, and reasonable on price. It's difficult to discover a sincere AC person and I'm thankful I found Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>
