<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a relatively easy to measure surrogate for indoor pollutants discharged by humans, and associates with human metabolic activity. Co2 at levels that are abnormally high inside may trigger occupants to grow sleepy, to get headaches, or to operate at lower activity levels. Outside CO2 levels are normally 350-450 ppm whereas the optimum indoor CO2 level considered acceptable is 1000 ppm. 28 Humans are the primary indoor source of carbon dioxide in most structures. Indoor CO2 levels are a sign of the adequacy of outdoor air ventilation relative to indoor resident density and metabolic activity.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the demand to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often performed in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
