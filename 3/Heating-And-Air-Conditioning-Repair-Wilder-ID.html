<p>Given that the 1980s, manufacturers of HVAC equipment have actually been making an effort to make the systems they make more effective.

In addition, enhancements to the HVAC system efficiency can likewise help increase resident health and performance. 21 In the US, the EPA has imposed tighter constraints throughout the years. There are several methods for making HVAC systems more efficient.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is permitted to vaporize, for this reason the heat exchanger is typically called an evaporating coil or evaporator.
