<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is regularly in the series of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), due to the fact that heat pumps become ineffective in more extreme cold. This is because ice types on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system should briefly switch back into the routine a/c mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to make up for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
