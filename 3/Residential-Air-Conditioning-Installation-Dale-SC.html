<h3>Residential Heat Pumps in Dale SC</h3>
<p>If your air conditioning system is more than eight years old, repair is most likely not worth the expense, unless it's a basic problem like particles obstructing the condenser unit or a worn fan belt.

<p>I have actually been working in HVAC for over 20 years. Now I am starting my own HVAC company. I can tell you that it is a tough task that the employees sweat and bleed at, specifically residential service. When there is no work there is no pay. That is where PMs work, keeps us in touch with consumers and keeps people working. When a sales guy comes to your house he is there to sell, that is the only way he is paid. You have an excellent Tech PM your system, he is paying costs and need to not "require" to sell you something you do not need. Your $1500 UV light is something you were sold on. For me, I provide you the options for your needs and you decide if you require it.<p>
