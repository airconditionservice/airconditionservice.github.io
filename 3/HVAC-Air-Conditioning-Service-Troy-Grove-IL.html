<p>Weatherization usually does not trigger indoor air issues by including new pollutants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can often emit pollutants.) Nevertheless, measures such as setting up storm windows, weather removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can minimize the quantity of outdoor air infiltrating into a house. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Central air conditioning conditioners, frequently described as central air" or split-system a/c", flow cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and signs up (i.e., openings in the ceilings, walls, or floors covered by grills) carry cooled air from the a/c unit to the house. This cooled air ends up being warmer as it distributes through the home; then it recedes to the central air conditioner through return ducts and registers. Discover how central air conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
