What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert going over my choices. After business hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and talk about alternatives. I scheduled my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a household friend and now I will advise this company to my good friends.<p>
