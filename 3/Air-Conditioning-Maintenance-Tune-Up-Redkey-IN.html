<p>The instructions that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfortable finishing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the new breaker and last connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We suggest you do the same. When the electrical wiring is complete, energize the system for a few minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable television heats up. Don't put the system into complete operation till the thin-set and grout have had time to correctly harden and treat-- normally two to four weeks. Then call the family together and play a game of Scrabble on your relaxing, warm bathroom flooring.<p>
<p>Start by checking out the installation handbook and familiarizing yourself with all the included hardware and fasteners.
