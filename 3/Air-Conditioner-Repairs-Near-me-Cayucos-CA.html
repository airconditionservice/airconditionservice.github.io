<p>Air conditioning can also be supplied by a process called complimentary cooling which utilizes pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heatpump to chill the circulation originating from the storage.
