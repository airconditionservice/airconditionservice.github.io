<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might think. Because many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive flexible tube) rather of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and use and is easily punctured.<p>
