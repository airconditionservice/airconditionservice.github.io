<p>Luis was immediately responsive to email and texts with questions. He dedicated to the job based just on emails, showed up and delivered with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs offer was one of the couple of sensible ones got. Others were nearly twice the amount Protex estimated for low end off brand name equipment. I got Carrier.

In addition, the big boosts in ventilation it takes to substantially reduce direct exposure to environmental tobacco smoke can also increase energy expenses substantially. Subsequently, the most effective method to decrease exposure to environmental tobacco smoke in the house is to remove cigarette smoking there.<p>
