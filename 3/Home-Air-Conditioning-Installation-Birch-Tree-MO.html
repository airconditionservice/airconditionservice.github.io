<p>Current Review: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He took the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and knowledgeable. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
