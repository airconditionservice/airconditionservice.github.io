<p>Due to the fact that it's the most typical heating system in Seattle homes, I'll begin with a natural gas furnace. Warm air is provided to the spaces of your house by means of ducts, and cool air is collected through cold air return vents. Gas heaters are rated for performance. Older systems from the 1970s might be ranked 65%, suggesting 35% of the heating energy is squandered throughout the combustion process. Today's designs vary from a minimum of 78% up to 98.5%.

However, high humidity outdoors produces the need for cautious attention to humidity levels indoors. High humidities trigger mold growth and moisture inside is related to a greater occurrence of occupant respiratory issues.<p>
