<p>If you believe a mold problem-- either due to the fact that of noticeable development or a moldy smell regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much excellent if it doesn't get rid of the mold. Mold begins with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can maintain and examine. Leaky return ducts can also introduce moisture. Again, if you believe a mold problem, consider having a service company inspect the duct system for leakages.<p>

Jamey Stephens of Evergreen Home Heating and Energy has enjoyed the single-family home installation business totally flip on its head the last few years. Winter season used to be the hectic season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summertime, with their generally two-week AC installation wait times swelling to as much as 3 months. It's been a cultural shift," states Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the climate and the people." And not just with beginners more accustomed to AC living. Longtime Seattle property owners are finally giving up, he says, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit houses with air-cooling systems.<p>
<p>Current Review: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He took the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and courteous. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
