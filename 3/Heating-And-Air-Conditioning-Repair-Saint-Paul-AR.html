<p>Information supplied in this security guide is based on current scientific and technical understanding of the concerns presented and is reflective of the jurisdictional boundaries developed by the statutes governing the co-authoring firms. The requirements do not need you to change your existing central air conditioning systems, and replacement parts and services should still be available for your house's systems. The "lifespan" of a central air conditioner is about 15 to twenty years. Producers generally continue to support existing equipment by making replacement parts available and honoring maintenance agreements after the new standard enters into impact.<p>

<h3>Natural Gas Furnace Service in Saint Paul AR</h3>
<p>It's not recommended for uncertified individuals to repair & check cooling & HVAC devices. There is a danger of electric shock & death if not correctly trained in emergency ac repair check-ups. If you left it to a qualified ac repair Houston Midtown tech for proper HVAC diagnosis, it would be best. When examining your air conditioning equipment to turn off all primary power from the emergency breaker panel or disconnect switch, constantly make sure. Be extremely careful when checking capacitors, even with the a/c system off. Capacitors can hold a high voltage charge, even with the power switched off. An unforeseen discharge from an a/c capacitor can trigger extreme injury or death.<p>
<p>Free cooling systems can have really high efficiencies, and are in some cases combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summertime air conditioning. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in due to the fact that the storage functions as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (instead of charging) mode, triggering the temperature to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
<p>Think about buying an energy-efficient design if your air conditioner is old. Look for the ENERGY STAR ® and EnergyGuide labels - certified central systems are about 15% more efficient than basic designs. New residential central air conditioner requirements entered into effect on January 1, 2015; see the performance standards for central air conditioners for details, and consider acquiring a system with a greater SEER than the minimum for higher cost savings.<p>
