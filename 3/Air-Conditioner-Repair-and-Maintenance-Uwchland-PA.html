<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have really small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the auto debit, although my company does not use auto debit lots of companies do so they can have a known amount of cash coming in every month, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. , if we do choose to provide auto debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Contract.. There must not be any reason that your company can not provide this. Hope this helps.<p>
