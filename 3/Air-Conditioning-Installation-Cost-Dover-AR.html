The decreased airflow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if several signs up were closed or the filter was clogged. Deice the A-coil if you've changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or till there's great airflow at the signs up.
