<p>Called WSE for a regular evaluation. The tech appeared right on time and was well-informed & friendly throughout the check out. They recommended replacing a couple of parts that were going out. They weren't low-cost however a quick internet search confirmed WSE wasn't pumping up rates, so I happily had them changed. However, a week later the furnace quit working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in exact same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they set up the week prior was malfunctioning. No charge for the see or the brand-new part. I was extremely delighted they stood by their work and repaired the problem. Will definitely be utilizing them again.<p>
<p>When installing the entire system, geothermal heat pump cost is far more than other heat pump types. Geothermal systems need underground ground loops to harness the Earth's natural energy.
