<p>The main problem when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external system to the internal ones. While setting up a different split system, workers attempt to locate both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Installing a multi-split system produces more troubles, given that some of indoor systems can be located far from the outside. The first designs of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not permit you to set the cooling separately for each room. However, now the marketplace has a large choice of multi-split systems, in which the practical attributes of indoor systems operate separately from each other.<p>

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is regularly in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps end up being ineffective in more severe cold. This is because ice kinds on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system must briefly switch back into the routine a/c mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
