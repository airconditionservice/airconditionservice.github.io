The compressor-based refrigerant systems are air-cooled, meaning they use air to exchange heat, in the very same method as a cars and truck radiator or typical household air conditioning unit does. Such a system dehumidifies the air as it cools it. It collects water condensed from the cooled air and produces hot air which should be vented outside the cooled location; doing so transfers heat from the air in the cooled location to the outdoors air.<p>
