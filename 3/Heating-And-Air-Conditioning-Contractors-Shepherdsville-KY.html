<p>When the heat pump went out in our workplaces, Taylor at Integrity was extremely useful in collecting information on the phone and offering clear instructions about how to temporarily manage the issue and prepare the heatpump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was remarkably efficient and provided clear communication about the issue, its solutions, and its future avoidance. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was friendly and professional. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will definitely use Integrity Energy Systems again, for workplace and home.<p>
