Install a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the traditional hot water heater are open, water will flow from the solar tank to the standard hot water heater (typical operation). If the valves on the water pipe getting in and the pipes leaving the traditional water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar storage tank past the conventional water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summertime when water temperature levels are high, and the conventional water heater can be shut off entirely.<p>
