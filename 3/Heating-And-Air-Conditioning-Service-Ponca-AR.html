<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You ought to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have really small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the car debit, although my company does not use automobile debit many companies do so they can have a known amount of money being available in on a monthly basis, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. If we do decide to use automobile debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There ought to not be any reason your company can not provide this. Hope this helps.<p>

<p>The company's head office is based in Cosmo City, Gauteng, and where they distribute their item in all areas in South Africa and nearby countries, such as Mozambique, Botswana, and Zimbabwe.

<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't lucrative you would not provide them.  Second of all like extended automobile warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is really sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the essential skills to do the job and likewise the morals to deal with clients fairly. As a client you need to be well notified in order not to be entirely benefited from. Many companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to correctly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to offer new versus repair. Lastly discovered somebody to effectively service and the system has been operating issue free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>

<p>Air conditioning can also be supplied by a process called free cooling which utilizes pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is included because the temperature level of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, therefore declining its effectiveness.<p>
<p>Numerous individuals are becoming more worried and aware about their health and the impact of indoor air quality. Dust and dirt including toxins and allergens can cover the cooling ductwork with time. Periodically it should be removed to boost and revitalize the quality of indoor air and enhance the cooling.
