<p>Next, and maybe simply as important when it pertains to central air costs, is the AC system's size. An unit that is too big will have an easy time keeping the house cool, but will have a harder time getting rid of humidity from the air.

Considering bigger units cost more than smaller units, it pays to ask a local HVAC professional what size AC unit your central air conditioning system needs to hold.<p>
