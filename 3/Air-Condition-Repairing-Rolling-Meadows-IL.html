Due to the fact that the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a little, economical versatile hose) instead of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to tear and use and is easily pierced.<p>
