<p>After residing in our home for 15 years we figured itâ $ s time to replace the cooling. I proceeded and bought this Carrier and I must state it does the job quite well. It takes extremely little time to warm up or cool off the house which is one of the things we didnâ $ t get from the one we had before. The system hasnâ $ t needed any repair work and Iâ $ ve had it for about half a year now.<p>

<p>When the heatpump went out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was extremely practical in collecting details on the phone and providing clear instructions about how to temporarily manage the issue and prepare the heat pump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was remarkably effective and used clear communication about the issue, its treatments, and its future prevention. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd prepared for, and the service was friendly and expert. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will absolutely use Integrity Energy Systems once again, for workplace and house.<p>
