<h3>Air Condition Repair in Lamont MI</h3>
<p>My home has 5 systems, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" found something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned up for an extra $30.00. (He actually stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I complained and got a refund) When this man belittled me for my "not comprehending", I tossed him off the home.<p>
<p>In an area where temperatures reach freezing, air-source heat pumps make good primary heating unit. You'll want to have a backup system set up, such as a gas furnace, which can take over when temperatures reach freezing.

The controls will call for the furnace to come on, effectively heating the home in these conditions.<p>
