Though just 33 percent of Seattle housing systems had air conditioning in 2015, more than 46,000 brand-new housing systems have been built in the four years considering that or are currently under building and construction.

<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high efficiencies, and are sometimes combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summer season air conditioning. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heatpump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added-in because the storage acts as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (rather than charging) mode, triggering the temperature to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
<p>In more complex plans, warm air is enabled to stream and increase out high building openings to the outdoors (stack effect ), triggering cool outdoors air to be drawn into low structure openings.

Air-side economizers likewise use outside air to condition spaces, but do so using fans, ducts, dampers, and control systems to present and distribute cool outdoor air when suitable.<p>
