<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the two specialists I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
