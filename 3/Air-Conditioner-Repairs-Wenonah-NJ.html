<p>All cooling contractors should begin their assessment of your home by carrying out an A/c Contractors of America Handbook J load estimation. This figures out the heat gain your home is subject to. The calculation is reasonably easy to carry out and will reveal what size unit you need. Move on to another contractor if the one you're considering wants to determine the ideal system for your house exclusively on experience. Though highly affected by where you live, a number of factors affect the size system required, including the amount of wall and attic insulation you have; the types and positioning of windows and doors; and the orientation of your house to the sun.
