<p>Due to the current Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to assist keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its finest. In some cases it's not a significant problem, and your system may merely need some maintenance work.

<p>The modeling efforts consist of the development and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality models, particularly the CONTAM series which forecasts air flows and contaminant concentrations in multizone structure systems. CONTAM is based upon a graphic user interface that permits the user to draw layout on a "sketchpad" and employ "icons" to represent airflow paths, ventilation system parts, and pollutant sources.

<p>Particular kinds of HVAC systems are a little more costly than wall units, ceiling or cassette systems are nicely hidden inside the ceiling in the class and are therefore more discreet and visually pleasing to look at.
