<p>Recent Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the 2 specialists I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
