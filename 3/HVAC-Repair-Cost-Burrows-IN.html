<p>Sean was extremely useful. He is a very pleasant person to work with. No pressure applied to buy additional stuff. Addressed all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He was able to put rise protectors on the unit and do the full maintenance on the unit. that was to ensure they were no concerns besides the blower motor. Due to the fact that there was not one on hand, the only reason he could not set up the new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he understands for sure what the concern is.<p>
<p>Four Seasons has actually installed both of my heaters and air conditioners, cleaned up the ducts and done the annual maintenance. I have discovered them to be fairly priced, timely and do great work.

No additional charge.<p>
