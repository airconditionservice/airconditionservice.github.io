<p>The federal government suggests that homes be weatherized in order to reduce the amount of energy required for heating & cooling. While weatherization is underway, nevertheless, actions must also be taken to lessen pollution from sources inside the house. (See "Improving the Air Quality in Your Home" for recommended actions.) In addition, residents must look out to the development of indications of inadequate ventilation, such as stuffy air, moisture condensation on cold surface areas, or mold and mildew development. Extra weatherization measures should not be undertaken up until these issues have actually been corrected.<p>
<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor free gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the eye, nose, and throat and causes shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the risk of breathing infection; there is also evidence from animal studies that duplicated exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the advancement of lung disease such as emphysema. People at particular risk from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide include kids and individuals with asthma and other respiratory diseases.<p>
