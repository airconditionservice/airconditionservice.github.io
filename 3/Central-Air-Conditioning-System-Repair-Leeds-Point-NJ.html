<p>Recent Evaluation: They were great! So many HVAC companies focus simply on upsell and forget to provide you with the service initially asked for.

And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I extremely recommend this company.<p>
<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is frequently in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heatpump end up being ineffective in more severe cold. This is due to the fact that ice types on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system need to temporarily change back into the routine a/c mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered just in this mode in order to compensate for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
