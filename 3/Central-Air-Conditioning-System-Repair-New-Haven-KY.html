<p>SysTech Style specializes in commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for enhancing and preserving the quality of the air in and around an industrial environment. The exact same is true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air before it distributes through your home. Condensed wetness can cause dust and other particles to stick to and develop on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils makes sure dirt doesn't develop and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from building up on and underneath the coils, which can cause mold issues.<p>
