<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our expert cleaning and sanitizing services are categorized as an Important Company in Los Angeles. Today's furnaces are rated 90% efficiency or better; it is not uncommon for a modern furnace to be rated 94 or 95% efficient. Compared to older models, which may be ranked as low as 80% effectiveness, this can suggest significant cost savings in yearly heating expenses. Modern two- and three-stage heating systems increase effectiveness even further by performing at lower or greater capacity depending upon the heating requirements of the area.<p>
<p>Rather of tying in to the ducts in your house, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head unit that installs on a wall. A ductless system has a built-in efficiency advantage because up to 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC system may be lost to leakages in your ducts. Ductless heatpump are excellent for additions due to the fact that they do not require any new ductwork to be installed. Because a system is installed in each room or location you wish to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature of each zone, which can conserve energy. Some mini-splits even have tenancy sensing units that instantly raise the temperature in the room when you exist.<p>
