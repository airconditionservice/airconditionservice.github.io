Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the required abilities to do the job and also the morals to deal with consumers fairly. As a customer you need to be well informed in order not to be completely taken advantage of. Most companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to effectively service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell new versus repair. Lastly discovered someone to effectively service and the system has been running problem complimentary for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
