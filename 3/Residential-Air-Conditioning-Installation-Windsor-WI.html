<h3>Efficient Heating and Air Conditioning Requires Proper Duct Sealing in Windsor WI</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Performance (97%) Phoenix Light Responsibility 50 gallon hot water heater. It went fantastic. Dealing with Braxten was an enjoyment.

<p>Have actually used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. When I have problems, they offer me top priority and a lower rate. Bought a brand-new main unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never buy prolonged service warranties or service arrangements on anything however HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Great investment in my opinion. Never attempt to sell me something I don't need.<p>
