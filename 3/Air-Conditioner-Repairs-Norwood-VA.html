<p>SysTech Design specializes in industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for enhancing and keeping the quality of the air in and around an industrial environment. The exact same is true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air before it circulates through your home. Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to stick to and build up on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils guarantees dirt doesn't build up and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from building up on and underneath the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>
<p>HVAC Systems Can Add To Air Quality Issues. HVAC systems can likewise exacerbate indoor air quality problems. The HVAC system may be contaminated (since of mold in duct lining or germs on coil or filters, for instance), and the system might spread these pollutants throughout the house. Second, the HVAC duct distribution system can spread out pollutants from one part of the house to another. Regular maintenance and duct sealing can assist reduce these problems.<p>
