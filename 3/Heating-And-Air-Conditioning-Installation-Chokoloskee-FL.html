<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is allowed to evaporate, hence the heat exchanger is typically called an evaporating coil or evaporator.

At the same time, heat is taken in from indoors and transferred outdoors, resulting in cooling of the building.<p>
<p>Central air conditioning conditioners, typically referred to as central air conditioning" or split-system a/c", flow cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and signs up (i.e., openings in the walls, ceilings, or floors covered by grills) carry cooled air from the air conditioning system to the home. This cooled air becomes warmer as it distributes through the home; then it recedes to the central air conditioner through return ducts and signs up. Find out how central air conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
