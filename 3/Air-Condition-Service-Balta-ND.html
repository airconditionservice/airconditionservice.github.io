Moisture management and humidity control might contravene efforts to try to enhance the operation to conserve energy. For instance, moisture management and humidity control needs systems to be set to provide make-up air at lower temperatures (design levels), rather of the higher temperatures in some cases used to conserve energy in cooling-dominated climate conditions. However, for most of the US and many parts of Europe and Japan, during the majority of hours of the year, outdoor air temperatures are cool enough that the air does not require further cooling to offer thermal comfort inside.

High humidities trigger mold growth and moisture inside is connected with a greater occurrence of occupant respiratory problems.<p>
<p>When your HVAC expert informs you to change your filters frequently, they're not joking. It's as essential as a routine oil modification in your cars and truck.

Additionally, a fresh, clean filter better traps contaminants and particles in the air. Energy Star suggests changing your filter as soon as every three months. Throughout high usage months, examine the filters a minimum of month-to-month.<p>
