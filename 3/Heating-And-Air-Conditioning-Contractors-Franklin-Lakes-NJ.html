<p>I have been using them for several years for my companies, my own homes and my property customers' houses. I went through five other companies before I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All five other companies estimated me with various costs and different problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th individual, who discussed to me thoroughly the concerns which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental home, another occasion. He assisted me trouble shoot the problem when I called and he encouraged me to call service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the system working again. He is truthful, reputable, and reasonable on rate. It's tough to find a truthful AC person and I'm pleased I discovered Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>
