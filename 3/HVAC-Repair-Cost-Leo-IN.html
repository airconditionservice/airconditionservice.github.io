<p>We're investing a lot more time indoors, these days. While many individuals presume pollution is simply an outside issue, your home (and workplace) can also be polluted. As a society, we make sure that our homes are well-sealed and well-insulated, however we don't believe adequate about direct exposure to all the important things we place in our homes," says Susan Olesik, PhD, Professor of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio.

<h3>Efficient Heating and Air Conditioning Requires Suitable Duct Sealing in Leo IN</h3>

<p>7 To evaluate it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect beside the compressor and the primary panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature listed below the room temperature, and then change it ON. To prevent straining an air conditioning unit's compressor, wait at least five minutes in between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You should hear the outside compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. If the fan isn't turning, try to find an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this).<p>

<p>The predominant health impact connected with exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels might pose dangers, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Significant health companies (like the Centers for Disease Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes thousands of avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number could range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. Your danger of lung cancer is especially high if you smoke and your house has high radon levels.<p>
