He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call service many years earlier and understand the value of having the right parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also impressed that he showed up at my house at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is often in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heatpump become ineffective in more extreme cold. This is since ice types on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil.
