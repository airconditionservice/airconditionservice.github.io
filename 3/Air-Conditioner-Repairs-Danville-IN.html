<h3>Three Essential Spring Furnace Maintenance Tips in Danville IN</h3>
<p>So it ended up that everything they did was 100% examination, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil modification' kind of maintenance as I have actually read here). The heat exchanger had a very little bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'might' trigger a problem in the future. So he stated I might switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both terrific. Simply today I noticed I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the exact same day. He knew just what the issue was and fixed it really rapidly. But here is the BEST ONE. About ten years ago my entire a/c and gas heat went completely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan was able to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he might have charged me for a lot more.<p>
