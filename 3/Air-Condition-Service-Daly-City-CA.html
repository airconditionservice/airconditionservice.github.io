<h3>HVAC Maintenance Near Me in Daly City CA</h3>
<p>If you presume a mold problem-- either since of visible growth or a musty smell consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much great if it does not get rid of the mold. Mold begins with a wetness problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can maintain and examine. Leaky return ducts can also introduce moisture. Again, if you suspect a mold issue, think about having a service company inspect the duct system for leakages.<p>
