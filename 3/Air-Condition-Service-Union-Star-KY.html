An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outside air through a damp pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is lowered. The temperature of the inbound air is decreased, however it is likewise more damp, so the total heat (sensible heat plus hidden heat) is the same.
