<p>How environment modification affects air quality and direct exposure to air pollutants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being kept at a set temperature (which is a standard modus operandi for modern air conditioners) needs that the rate of energy removal by the air conditioner increase. This boost has the impact that, for each unit of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the ac system gets rid of that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioner must increase its power intake by the inverse of its "efficiency" (coefficient of performance) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is activated, and the air conditioning system has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioning unit's power consumption will increase by 50 W to make up for this, hence making the 100 W heating aspect cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
