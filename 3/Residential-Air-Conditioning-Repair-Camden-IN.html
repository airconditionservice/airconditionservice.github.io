They came and stated it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the job, however they had to purchase it. My partner said that she had actually seen an excellent review for James, so I called. He can be found in a couple of hours (weaving a mask) and explained the situation to me. He said it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 overall. He offered to come back today, but I moved it to tomorrow. James is among the nicest, most good individuals I have actually met in a long time.
