According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air toxins are typically 2 to 5 times greater than outside levels, and in some cases these levels can exceed 100 times that of outdoor levels of the very same pollutants. To put it simply, in some cases the air inside can be more damaging than the air outside.<p>
<p>Air conditioner manufacturers normally make rugged, high quality items. Begin by checking any fuses or circuit breakers if your air conditioner stops working. Let the system cool off for about 5 minutes prior to resetting any breakers. If a central air conditioning conditioner's compressor stops on a hot day, the high-pressure limit switch may have tripped; reset it by pressing the button, situated in the compressor's gain access to panel.<p>
