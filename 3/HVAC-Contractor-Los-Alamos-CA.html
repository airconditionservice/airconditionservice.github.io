For example, wetness management and humidity control needs systems to be set to provide cosmetics air at lower temperatures (style levels), instead of the higher temperature levels sometimes used to save energy in cooling-dominated environment conditions.

<h3>Central Heating Installation Agency in Los Alamos CA</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Loan and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a government firm, performed a study in the 1990s to examine 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it lowers energy costs by enhancing airflow. After checking 33 houses in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the research study found that there was no significant enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance air flow or energy performance.

In other cases, particle levels reduced immediately after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
