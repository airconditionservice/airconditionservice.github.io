<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) describes air quality in indoor workplace, classroom or lab environments, rather than commercial or outdoor settings. In tasks where union subscription is not an issue, an HVAC technician may finish the assembly and installation of the ductwork that distributes the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system.

Leaking return ducts can likewise present wetness. Again, if you suspect a mold issue, consider having a service company examine the duct system for leaks.<p>
