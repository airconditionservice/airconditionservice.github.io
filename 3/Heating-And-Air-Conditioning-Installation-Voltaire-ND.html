<p>There are some more major threats for HVAC employees that could be potentially fatal. They can be exposed to Carbon Monoxide which can be dangerous. As HVAC specialists often enter contact with wiring, they risk being electrocuted. They can also suffer other kinds of abrasions and burns to the skin. Although there are threats related to the job, it is normally performed safely as long as appropriate care is taken.<p>
<p>Because they get rid of wetness from the air, Air conditioners can produce a lot of water. To eliminate this, they have a typically plastic drain pipeline that comes out of the side of the air handler. In time, algae can obstruct this pipeline and, when it does, the AC will not work. In truth, some condensate drains pipes have a float switch that will not let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can also puddle around the unit or flood the area. To handle condensate problems, please see Air conditioning unit Leaks Water, listed below.<p>
