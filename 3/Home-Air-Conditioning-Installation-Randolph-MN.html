<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier since the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>If your single phase air conditioning system isn't old enough to validate replacement, consider a whole house dehumidifier. By setting up dehumidification devices inside an existing single phase system, you can delight in a few of the benefits of a variable speed compressor without replacing any equipment. The dehumidifier will keep your relative humidity at a comfy level, improving indoor air quality and allowing higher comfort at higher temperature levels.<p>
