<p>Air conditioning can likewise be provided by a procedure called totally free cooling which uses pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heatpump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is included since the temperature of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, therefore declining its efficiency.<p>
