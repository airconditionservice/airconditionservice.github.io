The capability to cool and heat your house at optimal efficiency will depend a lot on how well insulated your home is currently and the size of your house. A 2500 square foot house will need a much larger AC unit than a smaller sized home, which will impact installation expenses. Likewise a home with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no fractures for air circulation will need far less AC capacity to keep temperature levels comfortable. Other factors that can impact this might be the insulation elsewhere such as the foundation, roof, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>

By contrast, replacing a furnace and inspecting filter can typically be carried out in simply a few minutes, frequently with no tools required. As a precaution, before cleaning your furnace filter, make sure to switch off the furnace either at the thermostat or utilizing the power switch, generally mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>
