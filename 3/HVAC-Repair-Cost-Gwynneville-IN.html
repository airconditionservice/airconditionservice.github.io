<p>For a heated flooring location less than 20 sq. ft., you could (in most cases) draw power from an adjacent GFCI-protected outlet without overloading the circuit. (If the thermostat you acquire is already GFCI protected like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad must be GFCI secured.) However a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can cause overloads and nuisance breaker trips. For our bigger mat, we chose to install a dedicated circuit with its own wiring and circuit breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are available.<p>
