<p>Ensure there are no carpets, furnishings, or anything else limiting the circulation of air. Not only will obstructed vents and registers affect your convenience, they can likewise result in duct leaks due to excessive air pressure and early HVAC repairs and breakdowns. Closing off vents and signs up in unused rooms is NOT a good idea. You won't save any money and will wind up triggering more problems for your heater.<p>
<p>This is especially significant, as gas stoves can trigger levels of pollution that would be illegal outdoors. According to the EPA, while houses without gas stoves have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), houses with well-adjusted gas ranges have levels that can range from 5 to 15 ppm, and houses with badly adjusted gas stoves can be 30 ppm or higher. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's standards.<p>
<p>Mobile houses are generally smaller than stick-built properties and utilize considerably less oil and a much smaller sized furnace to heat. Anticipate the average mobile home oil furnace to have beginning costs of around $1,500. Remember that not as lots of brand names produce oil heaters for this use, and you may find more options with natural gas, lp, or electric heaters.<p>

It's possible that the size of AC system you have is not huge enough for your house. If the system is too small, it will have to work harder and might overheat. Typically, an HVAC system costs $4,820 to $9,350 to set up a 5-ton unit for a 2,000- to 3,000-square-foot home.<p>
