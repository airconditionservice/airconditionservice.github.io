<h3>Ductless Air Conditioning For Swedesboro NJ Homes With No Air Ducts</h3>
<p>Among the primary factors a furnace will run continuously is due to the fact that something is clogged or unclean Before trying to fix any issue, take some time to ensure that the thermostat settings are not at continuous fan". If the air filter is great to go, check the furnace blower for obstructing and tidy it. Have an appearance at the furnace blower motor and oil it if this does not work. Contact an experienced technician if you still can not figure out why your furnace keeps running.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is normally a lack of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without airflow, wetness from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC system, let the ice melt, change the filter, and try once again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, because something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
