Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted right away, and when I changed my AC, they made 2 journeys to collaborate their deal with a company that was dealing with the patio area where the system sits.

<p>7 To test it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the detach next to the compressor and the primary panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature level listed below the room temperature level, and after that switch it ON.

You must hear the outside compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. If the fan isn't turning, look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this).<p>
