Location the a/c unit back into its original box, utilizing the dense-foam packing product to protect it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware items in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in package. Set package in a cool, dry place for the winter season. And if the storage room has a concrete floor, location two 2x4s underneath package to raise it up and protect it from moisture.<p>
<p>Underfloor heating is easy to set up, specifically if you make it part of a construct or remodelling project.
