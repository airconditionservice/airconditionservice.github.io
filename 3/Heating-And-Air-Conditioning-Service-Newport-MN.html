<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you might think. Due to the fact that the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a small, low-cost flexible pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to wear and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
