<p>The very first ac system and fridges used harmful or combustible gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or gas, that might lead to fatal mishaps when they dripped. Thomas Midgley, Jr. produced the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number showing the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The mix most used in direct-expansion house and structure convenience cooling is an HCFC referred to as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>

<p>Recent Evaluation: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and polite. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>

<p>The likelihood of immediate responses to indoor air pollutants depends on numerous factors. Age and preexisting medical conditions are two important influences. In other cases, whether an individual reacts to a toxin depends on individual level of sensitivity, which varies tremendously from person to individual. Some individuals can end up being sensitized to biological toxins after repeated direct exposures, and it appears that some people can end up being sensitized to chemical contaminants too.<p>
<p>Weatherization generally does not trigger indoor air problems by including new contaminants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases emit contaminants.) Nevertheless, measures such as setting up storm windows, weather condition removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can minimize the quantity of outside air penetrating into a home. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
