<p>Current Review: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and polite. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
