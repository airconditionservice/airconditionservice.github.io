<p>A/c can likewise be offered by a process called free cooling which uses pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heat pump to chill the flow coming from the storage.
