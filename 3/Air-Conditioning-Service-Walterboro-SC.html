<h3>HVAC Installation Near Me in Walterboro SC</h3>
<p>For a heated flooring area less than 20 sq. ft., you might (in many cases) draw power from a nearby GFCI-protected outlet without overwhelming the circuit. (If the thermostat you acquire is currently GFCI protected like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad must be GFCI secured.) However a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can trigger overloads and problem circuit breaker trips. For our larger mat, we elected to set up a dedicated circuit with its own electrical wiring and circuit breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are readily available.<p>
<p>When the heat pump went out in our workplaces, Taylor at Stability was really useful in gathering information on the phone and offering clear guidelines about how to briefly handle the problem and prepare the heatpump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely effective and offered clear communication about the issue, its remedies, and its future prevention. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd anticipated, and the service was professional and friendly. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will absolutely use Integrity Energy Systems again, for office and house.<p>
