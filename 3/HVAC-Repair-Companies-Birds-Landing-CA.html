<p>G&S did an excellent job installing our new furnace and AC system. The best thing about G&S is that they guarantee for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace failed within a couple of months (no fault of G&S). Producers service warranty would cover the parts cost however G&S repaired and covered labor cost under their service warranty. Likewise they identified the problem and repaired extremely quickly. Definitely A++ installation and service.<p>
<p>I am very pleased with this company. Among my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the problem within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call business many years back and know the significance of having the best parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also impressed that he appeared at my house at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will absolutely be using Waycoff's again, and would advise them to everybody. Thank You very much.<p>
<p>Indoor pollution sources that release gases or particles into the air are the primary reason for indoor air quality problems. Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor pollutant levels by not generating enough outside air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air toxins out of the location. Heat and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some toxins.<p>
