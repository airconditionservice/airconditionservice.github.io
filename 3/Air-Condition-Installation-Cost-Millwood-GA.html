<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a requirement for a/c unit repair, which you need to watch out for. First, you need to examine your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little ridiculous, however ice on your ac system can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly.<p>
