<h3>Hints to Help You Hire Ashby MA Professionals for Air Conditioning Repair</h3>
<p>In the last a number of years, a growing body of clinical proof has suggested that the air within houses and other structures can be more seriously contaminated than the outdoor air in even the biggest and most industrialized cities. Other research indicates that people spend approximately 90 percent of their time inside. Hence, for many individuals, the dangers to health may be higher due to exposure to air pollution inside your home than outdoors.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is typically a lack of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without air flow, moisture from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Turn off the AC unit, let the ice melt, change the filter, and try again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
