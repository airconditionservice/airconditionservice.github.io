Do It Yourself repair is possible, however the brand-new control panel must be installed exactly right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature is regularly in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps become ineffective in more extreme cold. This is because ice forms on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system should briefly switch back into the regular air conditioning mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered just in this mode in order to compensate for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
