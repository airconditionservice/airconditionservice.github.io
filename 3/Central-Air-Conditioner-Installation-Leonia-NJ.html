First, use exterior-grade pressed wood items made with phenol-formaldehyde resin in floorings, kitchen cabinetry, and wall surface areas. Or, as an alternative, think about using solid wood items. Second of all, if you plan to set up wall-to-wall carpet on concrete in contact with the ground, especially concrete in basements, ensure that a reliable wetness barrier is set up prior to installing the carpet.
