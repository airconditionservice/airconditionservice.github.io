<p>Proper ventilation helps improve indoor air quality. It's easy to think that the air quality outside is even worse than the air quality inside. We understand about air contamination and acid rain, we can see smoke and odor exhaust, and we may even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck gush thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air contaminants are frequently 2 to 5 times greater than outdoor levels, and in some cases these levels can go beyond 100 times that of outdoor levels of the same pollutants. In other words, often the air inside can be more harmful than the air outside.<p>
<p>HVAC Systems Can Contribute to Air Quality Problems. HVAC systems can likewise exacerbate indoor air quality issues. The HVAC system might be infected (due to the fact that of mold in duct lining or bacteria on coil or filters, for example), and the system may spread out these pollutants throughout the house. Second, the HVAC duct circulation system can spread toxins from one part of the home to another. Routine maintenance and duct sealing can help decrease these problems.<p>

<p>Ducted heat pump cooling and heating systems act similar to conventional central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas via a duct system. If your home or structure has an existing duct system that is in good shape, a ducted heat pump system may be most cost effective. Utilizing existing ductwork will eliminate the need to install a costly new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>Furthermore, radiators heat the air nearest them initially, which is why spaces warmed by radiators are susceptible to cold spots", suggesting that the air feels cold in the middle of the room and very hot next to the radiators. This generally leads to opening a window above the radiator to bring some fresh air in, and there we go once again, letting all that energy paid to warm up your house escape out of the window. Radiant heat supplies heat from the floor up throughout the room with no cold spots or stuffiness in the location being heated up.<p>

These charges will be included in the installation costs.<p>
