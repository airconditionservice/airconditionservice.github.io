<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel often receives requests for assessment and assistance in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal companies. During the 1970s, many property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation procedure. However, many of these houses were discovered to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this product. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was installed several years ago are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
