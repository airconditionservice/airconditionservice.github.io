<p>The quality of the air inside our homes, work environments and schools matters, particularly because we spend most of our lives indoors. Air conditioning system help to dehumidify the incoming air, but in exceptionally damp climates or in cases where the air conditioning system is extra-large, it might not accomplish a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned house will increase your energy usage, both for the dehumidifier itself and due to the fact that the a/c unit will require more energy to cool your home. A preferable alternative is a dehumidifying heat pipe, which can be included as a retrofit to many existing systems.<p>
<p>Instead of incorporating to the ducts in your home, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head unit that installs on a wall.

Ductless heatpump are great for additions since they do not need any brand-new ductwork to be installed. Since a system is set up in each room or area you wish to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature of each zone, which can conserve energy. Some mini-splits even have tenancy sensors that immediately raise the temperature level in the room when you exist.<p>
