Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts.

The technician invested a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
