<p>A geothermal heater does not create its power by burning fossil fuels such as gas, oil, or coal. Rather, it absorbs heat from within the earth. In addition, a geothermal cooling and heating system utilizes significantly less electrical power compared to a standard electric heat-resistance heatpump.

<p>When your HVAC professional tells you to change your filters frequently, they're not kidding. It's as crucial as a routine oil modification in your cars and truck.

Additionally, a fresh, clean filter more effectively traps pollutants and debris in the air. Once every three months, Energy Star recommends replacing your filter. During high usage months, check the filters a minimum of regular monthly.<p>
