<p>It is common to presume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable with time. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a building as fairly the same physical product with time. In fact, the true nature of buildings can be viewed as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be explained and understood as intricate systems. Research study applying the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment thinking about the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
