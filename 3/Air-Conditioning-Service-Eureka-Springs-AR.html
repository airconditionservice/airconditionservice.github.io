<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
