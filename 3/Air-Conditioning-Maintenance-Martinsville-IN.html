<p>The Canada Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a government company, performed a research study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it minimizes energy expenses by enhancing air flow. After checking 33 homes in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the research study found that there was no considerable enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy performance. In some cases, determined particle levels really increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased instantly after cleaning however went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>4 Seasons has actually installed both of my heaters and air conditioners, cleaned up the ducts and done the yearly maintenance. I have actually found them to be fairly priced, timely and do great work. When they installed my primary furnace they worked out beyond what was essential and redid the entire plenum and the duct work for the water heater since the technicians believed they just didn't seem best and they could not leave them that way. No extra charge.<p>
