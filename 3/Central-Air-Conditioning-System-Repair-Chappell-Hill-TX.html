<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that utilizes low-voltage power from the thermostat to switch 220-volt high-amperage existing to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can break and are at the top of the list of typical cooling service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to replace it every five years or so.

For instance, in schools asbestos requires to be examined every 3 years and re-inspected every 6 months (under the Asbestos Threat Emergency Reaction Act-AHERA).<p>
