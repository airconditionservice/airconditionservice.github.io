<h3>The Operation of the Boiler Burner in Lebanon Junction KY</h3>
<p>The remainder of the HVAC system likewise needs to be in leading condition for the air conditioner to work well. This consists of the air handler, evaporator coil, ductwork and registers, all of which live inside the home. If the private parts remain in appropriate order, the technician can analyze the ductwork for indications of holes, gaps or excessive dirt. Sealing leakages in ductwork can improve HVAC performance by as much as 30 percent, and provide for a cooler house in the hot summertime.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outside air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the demand to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often performed in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
