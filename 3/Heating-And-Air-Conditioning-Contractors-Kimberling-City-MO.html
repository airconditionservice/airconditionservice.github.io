<p>Because my furnace was not working, I called Snowflake Air. Jose and his assistant showed up on time. Jose spent time troubleshooting the problem, all the while explaining everything to me. After discovering the thermostat was not working correctly. He had to go get the proper replacement. After the installation of the new thermostat, Jose discussed the operation and programing to me. I will certainly utilize Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
