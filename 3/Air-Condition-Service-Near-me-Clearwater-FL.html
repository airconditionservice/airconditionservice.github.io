<p>In a common residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar made to his workers, devices costs, marketing, utilities, and other costs before paying himself anything. Normally this leaves about 6% of earnings to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This does not sound like much, especially if the objective of owning a company was for monetary liberty. Plus, this 6% wants the couple of years it required to develop the business and not taking an earnings as the owner. However, this 6% generally isn't the end goal. HVAC entrepreneur need to strive for 10-15% by cutting expenses in some locations or increasing their revenues while keeping costs the same in all other locations.<p>
