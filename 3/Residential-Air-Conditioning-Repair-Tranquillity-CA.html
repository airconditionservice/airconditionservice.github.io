<p>Radiant heat covers a range of various heating systems, consisting of electric heaters and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heating systems operate on comparable principles. In the case of a boiler, the system heats up by distributing hot water through a series of pipes installed in the sub-floor of each space. In the case of electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating components. As the warm water (or electricity) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the flooring and into the space.<p>

<p>Packaged terminal air conditioning system (PTAC) systems are likewise called wall-split air conditioning systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are often used in hotels, have two separate systems (terminal plans), the evaporative system on the interior and the condensing unit on the exterior, with an opening passing through the wall and linking them. This reduces the interior system footprint and permits each space to be changed separately. PTAC systems might be adapted to supply heating in cold weather, either directly by using an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to draw and heat the interior heat from the exterior air, transforming the a/c unit into a heat pump While room air conditioning provides maximum flexibility, when used to cool lots of spaces at a time it is generally more expensive than central air.<p>
