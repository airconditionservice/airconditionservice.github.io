<p>To put this simply, Preventative maintenance is VITAL TO maintain the performance and performance of your HVAC system, multiple studies through DOE and ACCA can confirm this if you're interested. However, select your contractor carefully, a number of the 'trustworthy' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not immune to improper sales methods that DO make the most of uninformed homeowners. Once again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid website with an agenda. While Angie's list is a great base line indicator that you MIGHT be working with a reliable company, you still need to do your research (not all contractors with a similar ranking are the exact same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (Cooling contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>Likewise, there are natural causes for indoor air contamination. For example, human beings exhale carbon dioxide, which in little quantities is not harmful, but might end up being dangerous if high concentrations are enabled to accumulate. Micro-organisms or germs might also exist within the ventilation system. They might spread out throughout the entire work environment or building by ways of the ventilation system if micro-organisms do establish.<p>
