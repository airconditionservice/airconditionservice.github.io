<p>Seattle furnaces can run 9 months of the year. Based on the typical temperatures in our area, if you compared running your furnace to a cars and truck it would get the equivalent of 1.8 million miles over its anticipated life-span of 15 years. Your heating unit will work hard for you, but like your cars and truck, doing routine and regular maintenance will keep it running smoothly, avoid problems, and keep your warranty intact.<p>
<p>A cars and truck's coolant system transfers excess heat from one part of the engine and finally loses it through the radiator fins. With time, the coolant becomes unclean and old. The old coolant will negatively impact the system's performance. To ensure the system is working effectively, consider having a routine coolant system flush. A coolant flush is fundamental maintenance for your automobile's cooling system. Call 206-523-2133 or go to Acme Vehicle Electric & Repair in Seattle, WA 98103 for all your coolant system flush and fill needs.<p>
<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your car's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by distributing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant streams. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine might harm the engine elements. To avoid this from occurring, have your radiator serviced frequently. To have your radiator requires dealt with by experts, see Eric's Garage today.<p>
