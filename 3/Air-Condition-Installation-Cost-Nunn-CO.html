<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a requirement for air conditioning unit repair, which you ought to watch out for. Initially, you ought to check your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little unreasonable, but ice on your air conditioning unit can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately if entirely iced over.<p>
