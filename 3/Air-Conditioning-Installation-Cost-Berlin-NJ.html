<p>Recent Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company because the two technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Current Review: They were terrific! Numerous HVAC companies focus simply on upsell and forget to offer you with the service initially requested. They fulfilled my needs completely by providing an expert quote with options, without pressing extra products. The team appeared on time, kept me notified as they worked, and ended up a little early. The likewise promptly followed up with the required inspections from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I extremely advise this company.<p>
<p>By piping coolant straight into the smaller wall-mounted systems, ductless splits permit you to avoid the requirement for a full duct system like most other cooling systems need. You will likewise enjoy a much more flexible system in terms of installation and cost. And since each indoor system has its own thermostat, you can bid farewell to thermostat warfare when one person would choose it a little warmer in a different space.<p>
