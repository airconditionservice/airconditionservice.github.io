The effectiveness of an air cleaner depends upon how well it collects contaminants from indoor air (expressed as a portion effectiveness rate) and just how much air it draws through the cleaning or filtering aspect (expressed in cubic feet per minute).

<p>The results of lead exposure on fetuses and kids can be serious. They include delays in physical and mental development, lower IQ levels, shortened attention periods, and increased behavioral issues. Children, fetuses, and infants are more susceptible to lead direct exposure than grownups given that lead is more quickly absorbed into growing bodies, and the tissues of children are more sensitive to the destructive effects of lead. Children might have greater direct exposures since they are more likely to get lead dust on their hands and after that put their fingers or other lead-contaminated things into their mouths.<p>

The furnace might heat the home too rapidly and shut down for too long, resulting in irregular temperature level levels.<p>
