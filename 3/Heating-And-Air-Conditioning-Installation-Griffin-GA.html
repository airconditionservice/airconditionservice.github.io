<h3>The Function of the Boiler Burner in Griffin GA</h3>
<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is connected to a remote condenser unit utilizing refrigerant piping in between a outdoor and indoor unit instead of ducting air directly from the outside system. Indoor systems with directional vents mount onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or fit into the ceiling. Other indoor units install inside the ceiling cavity, so that brief lengths of duct deal with air from the indoor system to vents or diffusers around the spaces.<p>
<p>Four Seasons has set up both of my heaters and air conditioners, cleaned the ducts and done the annual servicing. I have actually found them to be fairly priced, prompt and do fine work. When they installed my primary furnace they worked out beyond what was necessary and renovated the whole plenum and the duct work for the water heater since the service technicians thought they just didn't appear right and they could not leave them that method. No extra charge.<p>
