<p>Exposure Control: Changing the time and area of contaminant direct exposure. An example of time control is setting up flooring stripping and waxing (with the ventilation system functioning) on a Friday. This permits items to off-gas over the weekend while the majority of the personnel are at home over the weekend. Location control involves moving the pollutant source far from residents or even transferring vulnerable residents.<p>
<p>Air flow patterns in structure are identified by the combined forces of mechanical ventilation systems, human activity, and natural effects. Air pressure differences created by these forces move airborne contaminants from locations of higher pressure to areas of lower pressure through any available opening in structure walls, ceilings, floors, doors, windows, and HVAC systems. Even if the opening is small, air will move until the inside pressure is equal to the exterior.<p>
<p>If a contractor does not have a strong grasp of local policies or suitable local, regional, and federal rewards-- like the ones found at the Database of State Incentives for Renewables and Performance, they might leave that to you and subsequently lower their costs since they have less paperwork to stress over.
