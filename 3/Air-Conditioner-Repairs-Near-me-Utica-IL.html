Loosen the old AC contactor before removing the wires. Then move the wires to the new unit (Image 6).<p>

<h3>Central Heating Systems in Utica IL</h3>
<p>All heating systems have some level of air filtration. From the most fundamental, 1-inch filter in the blower cabinet, to the bigger, 4-inch media filter typically in its own cabinet outside the furnace, to the more sophisticated electronic air cleaners and air cleansers, all need some fundamental maintenance. These filters help with indoor air quality by trapping airborne toxins streaming through your system. They can also keep your system performing well by helping reduce the accumulation of dust, dirt and other particles from collecting on internal components like the blower motor, burners and heat exchanger.<p>
<p>Devices costs are driven by the kind of furnace at the heart of your home heater. Low-efficiency designs will cost less, but lead to greater energy expenses. High-efficiency models cost more, however conserve more over the long haul. Costs for gas heating systems range from $1,360 for the low-efficiency models up to $12,500 for high-efficiency models. Electric furnaces begin at $395 and range as much as $1,700 or more depending upon the brand and furnace size.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is allowed to vaporize, thus the heat exchanger is often called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant vaporizes it absorbs heat from the inside air, go back to the compressor, and repeats the cycle. While doing so, heat is absorbed from inside your home and transferred outdoors, resulting in cooling of the structure.<p>
