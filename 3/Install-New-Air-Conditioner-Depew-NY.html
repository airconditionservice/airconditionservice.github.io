<h3>AC Maintenance Near Me in Depew NY</h3>

The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the buildup of carbon dioxide to quasi "steady state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. For that reason, measurements of co2 for purposes of examining the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after a prolonged period of steady occupancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in offices a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to determine carbon dioxide ought to be calibrated frequently, and outdoor measurements utilized for calculations must be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature impacts on measurements made outdoors may also be required.<p>
