<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â A lot of heating systems have numerous control boards. The largest, or just one in some heaters, is sometimes called the Motherboard. The circuit boards coordinate the operation and control of the motors, sensors, ignitor, gas valve and more. DIY repair is possible, however the new control panel should be set up exactly right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work. Plus, if the problem isnâ $ t effectively identified, altering a board wonâ $ t repair it, and boards are not returnable when installed. Itâ $ s wise to leave this repair to a professional to detect.<p>
