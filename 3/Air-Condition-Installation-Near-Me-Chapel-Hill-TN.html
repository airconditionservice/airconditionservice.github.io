<p>Heating units are home appliances whose function is to produce heat (i.e. warmth) for the structure. This can be done via central heating Such a system contains a boiler, furnace, or heat  pump to heat water, steam, or air in a central place such as a furnace room in a home, or a mechanical room in a big structure.

<p>Moisture management and humidity control requires running HVAC systems as created. Moisture management and humidity control might contravene efforts to try to enhance the operation to conserve energy. For example, wetness management and humidity control requires systems to be set to provide make-up air at lower temperatures (design levels), rather of the higher temperatures in some cases used to conserve energy in cooling-dominated climate conditions. Nevertheless, for the majority of the US and numerous parts of Europe and Japan, during the majority of hours of the year, outside air temperature levels are cool enough that the air does not require additional cooling to provide thermal comfort indoors.
