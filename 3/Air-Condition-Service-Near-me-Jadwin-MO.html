This warmed air is then dispersed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or gas, however some are electrically powered as well.<p>
<p>A bioaerosol is an air-borne item of a biological impurity. Biological contaminants in the house might include mold, bacteria, viruses, mites, and pollen.
