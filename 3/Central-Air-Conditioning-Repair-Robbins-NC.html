They discovered the problem and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He took the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and knowledgeable. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
