<p>WE ARE ALSO OFFERING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL COMFORT CONSULTATIONS. Bypass valve: Run a pipeline between the water pipe going into and the water pipe leaving the conventional hot water heater. Install a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the traditional hot water heater are open, water will stream from the solar tank to the conventional hot water heater (regular operation). If the valves on the water pipe entering and the pipes leaving the conventional water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar storage tank past the traditional water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summer season when water temperature levels are high, and the conventional hot water heater can be shut off entirely.<p>
<p>A clogged furnace filter can cause a furnace to turn off. Unclean filters are the most common cause of furnace problems. Dust and dirt limit air flow-- and if the filter gets too stopped up, the heat exchanger will shut and get too hot off too quickly, and your house will not heat up. Replace the filter if the blower is running but no heat is coming out. A dirty filter also triggers soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, reducing the effectiveness of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>
