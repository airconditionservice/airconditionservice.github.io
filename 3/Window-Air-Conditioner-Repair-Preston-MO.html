<p>Current Review: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day.

<p>It is common to presume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady over time. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a building as fairly the same physical material over time. In fact, the real nature of buildings can be deemed the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be explained and comprehended as complicated systems. Research using the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the developed environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
