The heat exchanger had a really small bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'could' cause a problem in the future. So he stated I might swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the exact same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>An excellent place to begin is to compare your oil or gas furnace age to the nationwide average. The typical life span of heaters in homes today is in between 16 and 20 years.

The majority of people choose to change their furnace as a prepared home enhancement instead of a panic replacement when your furnace is faltering or has currently typical life-span of a warm air furnace will vary based upon its operating environment, that's why it's important to have the system serviced regularly by a qualified technician. They will have the ability to correctly assess the condition of the furnace and make any recommendations.<p>
