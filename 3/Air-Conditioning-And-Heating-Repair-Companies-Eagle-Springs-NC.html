<p>My "C" rating is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heat pump. The system runs silently and effectively, but to have two significant components stop working in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant dependability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (defrost control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were noted on the invoice before work started. Parts were covered by service warranty. Tax added another $53. The work was finished in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>

<p>Typically the most reliable method to improve indoor air quality is to eliminate private sources of contamination or to decrease their emissions. Some sources, like those that contain asbestos, can be sealed or enclosed; others, like gas stoves, can be gotten used to reduce the amount of emissions. In many cases, source control is also a more cost-efficient technique to securing indoor air quality than increasing ventilation because increasing ventilation can increase energy expenses. Specific sources of indoor air pollution in your house are noted later on in this section.<p>
<p>Central air conditioners, often referred to as central air" or split-system air conditioning", flow cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and registers (i.e., openings in the walls, floors, or ceilings covered by grills) bring cooled air from the air conditioner to the house. This cooled air ends up being warmer as it distributes through the house; then it flows back to the central air conditioning conditioner through return ducts and signs up. Learn how central air conditioning conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
