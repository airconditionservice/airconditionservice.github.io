Until 2006, 10 SEER was standard, but these days, the minimum permitted by federal law is 13 SEER.

<h3>Repair and Care for North Arlington NJ Commercial Air Conditioning</h3>
<p>During winter season, the ground source heat is absorbed by pumping a water-based and anti-freeze service through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid circulates around this loop, transferring the soaked up heat to a refrigerant via the evaporator, altering it from a liquid to gas.

From here, the gas relocates to the condenser, which moves the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heating unit.<p>
