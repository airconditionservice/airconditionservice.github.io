<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Illness is triggered by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The primary route of exposure is through the creation of an aerosol impact, many commonly from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A typical source of Legionella in commercial structures is from badly positioned or maintained evaporative cooling towers, which frequently release water in an aerosol which might get in nearby ventilation intakes. Break outs in medical centers and nursing homes, where patients are immuno-weak and immuno-suppressed, are the most typically reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has included outdoor water fountains in public tourist attractions. The presence of Legionella in commercial structure water products is extremely under-reported, as healthy individuals require heavy direct exposure to obtain infection.<p>
