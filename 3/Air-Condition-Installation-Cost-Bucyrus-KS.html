<p>Called WSE for a routine assessment. The tech showed up right on time and was friendly & knowledgeable throughout the check out. They recommended replacing a couple of parts that were going out. They weren't low-cost however a fast web search confirmed WSE wasn't inflating rates, so I gladly had them changed. Nevertheless, a week later on the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in very same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they installed the week prior was malfunctioning.
