<p>SysTech Design focuses on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for improving and maintaining the quality of the air around a commercial environment. The same is true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air before it flows through your house. Condensed moisture can trigger dust and other particles to stay with and build up on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils ensures dirt does not develop and get drawn into the system. It likewise prevents water from collecting on and below the coils, which can cause mold issues.<p>

Not only was the price great but Mark headed out of his way to tailor a couple of things in my home to make the general air circulation more optimized. I think it literally only took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my system installed. I have no doubt any future company related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
