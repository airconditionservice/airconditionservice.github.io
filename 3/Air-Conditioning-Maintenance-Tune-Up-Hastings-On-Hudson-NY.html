<p>Central air systems are measured in lots. This measurement is based on the system's capability to cool your home. For instance, a 1 lot unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 increase in tons, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This indicates a 4.5 load unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't acquainted with the term BTU, it implies the quantity of energy needed to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F °.<p>
<p>Asthmatic kids are specifically at threat. EPA estimates that exposure to secondhand smoke increases the number of episodes and intensity of signs in hundreds of countless asthmatic kids, and may cause thousands of nonasth-matic children to develop the disease each year. EPA estimates that between 200,000 and 1,000,000 asthmatic children have their condition made worse by direct exposure to previously owned smoke each year. Direct exposure to previously owned smoke triggers throat, eye, and nose irritation. It may impact the cardiovascular system and some research studies have linked exposure to pre-owned smoke with the beginning of chest discomfort. For publications about ETS, go to the IAQ Publications page, or contact EPA's Indoor Air Quality Info Clearinghouse (IAQ INFORMATION), 800-438-4318 or (703) 356-4020.<p>
<p>Individuals operating in buildings with bad IAQ may discover moldy or undesirable odors or may feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about signs that happen at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more major issue. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been connected to IAQ issues. Talk to your medical professional about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting worse. But not all direct exposures cause signs, so there is no alternative to great building management.<p>
