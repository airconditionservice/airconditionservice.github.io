<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have extremely small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing.

If we do decide to offer vehicle debit we would likewise have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There should not be any reason why your company can not use this. Hope this assists.<p>
