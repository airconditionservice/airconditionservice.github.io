<h3>The Smart Homeowner's Checklist for All Things HVAC Repairin Acton CA</h3>
<p>Most residential heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The current pattern in house construction is to reduce air leak through fractures and other openings in roofs, floorings, and walls. The combination of these building practices and the recirculation of indoor air has led to an increase in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside make-up air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living areas of residential structures. The ASHRAE guidelines for cosmetics air for kitchens and bathrooms in houses are much greater. This fresh make-up air waters down indoor contaminants and assists tire them from the home.<p>
<p>Current Review: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He made the effort to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and polite. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
