<p>The quality of the air inside our schools, offices and houses matters, particularly considering that we spend the majority of our lives inside. Air conditioners assist to dehumidify the inbound air, but in exceptionally damp environments or in cases where the a/c unit is extra-large, it might not attain a low humidity.

A more effective option is a dehumidifying heat pipeline, which can be included as a retrofit to many existing systems.<p>

What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long method. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert discussing my options. After business hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and go over alternatives. I scheduled my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their method. We were referred by a household pal and now I will advise this company to my pals.<p>
