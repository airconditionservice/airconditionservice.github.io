<h3>HVAC Repair Cost in Clearwater Beach FL</h3>
<p>I have been using them for many years for my services, my own houses and my realty customers' houses. I went through five other companies before I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All five other companies quoted me with various rates and different problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth person, who described to me thoroughly the concerns which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC stopped working at my rental house. When I called and he encouraged me to get in touch with service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the system working once again, he helped me problem shoot the issue. He is sincere, trusted, and affordable on rate. It's difficult to find a truthful AC man and I'm glad I found Luis. Extremely recommend Luis and his company.<p>
