<p>Enhance your services, make more services profits, and provide an amazing customer experience. To ensure the unit you choose is the ideal size for your house, the Sears HVAC expert does an electronic load computation estimate to determine the precise kind of heat and air conditioning system that's perfect for your home-we do not simply replace it with the exact same size unit you currently have. These calculations take into account things such as the size of your home, its direct exposure to the sun and wind, the number and size of windows, how well insulated it is and more. This step is vital so the system isn't too small or too large-both waste energy.<p>

Make sure that the glycol loop connections to the heat exchanger and the hot and cold water connections are accessible if the heat exchanger is internal to the storage tank. If the heat exchanger is external to the tank, it is most likely that it is supported by the pipes. Set up unions at the storage tank and heat exchanger connections so that the piping will not have to be cut if the tank or heat exchanger ever need to be changed.<p>
