<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a requirement for air conditioner repair, which you need to look out for. Initially, you should examine your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little ridiculous, but ice on your a/c can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air.

If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly.<p>
