<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively used in dry cleaning. In lab studies, it has been shown to cause cancer in animals. Recent studies indicate that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned goods are kept and as they use dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical throughout the pressing and finishing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to reduce your exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical smell when you select them up, do not accept them up until they have actually been appropriately dried. If goods with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent check outs, try a different dry cleaner.<p>
