EPA's booklet, Residential Air-Cleaning Devices, offers further details on air-cleaning devices to decrease indoor air pollutants.<p>
<p>A/c can likewise be supplied by a procedure called complimentary cooling which uses pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heatpump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage.
