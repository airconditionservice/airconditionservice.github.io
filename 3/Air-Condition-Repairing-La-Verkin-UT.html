<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to finish. I 'd priced out new units and installation for months. Once I chose to final progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Heap unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not only was the price great but Mark headed out of his way to tailor a few things in my home to make the general air flow more enhanced.
