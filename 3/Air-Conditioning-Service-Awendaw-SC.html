<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to complete. I 'd priced out new units and installation for months. Once I decided to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Heap unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not just was the rate great however Mark headed out of his method to tailor a few things in my home to make the overall air flow more enhanced. I think it literally only took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future company associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<h3>Have Your HVAC System Serviced Annually in Awendaw SC</h3>
<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% assessment, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil change' type of maintenance as I have actually checked out here). The heat exchanger had a really small bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'might' cause an issue in the future. So he stated I could swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>Open windows or use exhaust fans. Ventilation, a common method of reducing direct exposure to indoor air pollutants, also will lower however not remove direct exposure to ecological tobacco smoke. Because smoking produces such big amounts of contaminants, mechanical or natural ventilation techniques do not remove them from the air in your house as rapidly as they build up. In addition, the big increases in ventilation it requires to substantially reduce exposure to ecological tobacco smoke can likewise increase energy costs substantially. As a result, the most efficient way to minimize direct exposure to environmental tobacco smoke in the house is to get rid of cigarette smoking there.<p>

<p>I am extremely amazed with this company. Among my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the issue within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call business several years earlier and understand the value of having the right parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also satisfied that he showed up at my house at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will certainly be using Waycoff's once again, and would recommend them to everybody. Thank You very much.<p>
