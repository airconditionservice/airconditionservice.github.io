<p>Because it has to run longer than a properly sized system, an undersize system will not be able to cool rooms down entirely on the hottest days and will cost more to run. Since it merely takes more electrical power to run a bigger unit, a large-scale compressor likewise costs more to operate. And a large-scale system doesn't lower humidity successfully.
