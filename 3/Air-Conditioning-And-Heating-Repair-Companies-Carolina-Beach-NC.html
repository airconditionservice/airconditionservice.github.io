<h3>Heating And Air Conditioning Repair in Carolina Beach NC</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never have heard of the $5000 guideline but got ta give whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one inside and never ever requires maintenance and one outdoors and requires annual or perhaps bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to buy stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up rather than buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just crazy and all over the place and I think they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
