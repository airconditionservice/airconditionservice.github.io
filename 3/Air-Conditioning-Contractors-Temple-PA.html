<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider since the two professionals I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

Meanwhile, in huge box stores like Best Buy, the box fans and window AC units are nabbed up as quickly as they're stacked in flooring screens. Seattle may be the last city in the country to face the truth of a vicious, harsh summer.<p>
