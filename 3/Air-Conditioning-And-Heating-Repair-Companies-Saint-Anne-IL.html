<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 entered into force in 2000 and banned making use of ozone diminishing HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in brand-new systems. The Policy banned using R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This means that equipment that utilizes R22 can still operate, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now banned, systems that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and maintained.<p>

The significant factors for the majority of property owners will be the total cost to install the very best ac system brand names, life expectancy of the AC system, warranties used, energy effectiveness (SEER ratings), and size of the system you need for your home's square footage (HEAPS) to efficiently cool your house.<p>
<p>As a lot of you pointed out, preventative maintenance is needed by all major equipment maker's to ensure your factory service warranties stay in location. In addition, the tangible outcomes of a PM is frequently hard to measure, as one reaction mentioned the savings in performance or repairs that were prevented. Most pieces of a furnace or air conditioning system don't just break at the snap of a finger, but instead is the result of recurring use of a component that is out of balance. For example, a heat exchanger might stop working prematurely due to the fact that the gas pressure was operating to high, preparing the metal and causing early degeneration, leading to fractures and holes. , if that client had gotten a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure remains in line and protects the element.. a very advantageous outcome and one that was no cost at the time of service, but one that possibly saved a client thousands.<p>
