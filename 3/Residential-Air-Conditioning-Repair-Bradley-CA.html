<p>We tend to consider air contamination as something outdoors - smog, haze, or ozone hanging in the air, particularly in summer. These convection heating units are still extensively used and are generally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is generally oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered as well.<p>

<p>I have been working in HVAC for over twenty years. Now I am beginning my own HVAC company. I can tell you that it is a tough job that the workers sweat and bleed at, specifically residential service. When there is no work there is no pay.

<p>Current Review: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and polite. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
