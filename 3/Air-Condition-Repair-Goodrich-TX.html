<p>They were terrific! A lot of HVAC companies focus just on upsell and forget to offer you with the service initially asked for. They met my needs entirely by offering an expert quote with choices, without pressing additional items. The crew showed up on time, kept me informed as they worked, and finished a little early. The likewise without delay followed up with the essential inspections from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I highly advise this company.<p>
<p>If the AC does not switch off, it may be time to clean the condensing uni t Dirty condenser coils won't release heat efficiently and will keep the unit running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay might have welded together-- something that can happen in time due to the fact that of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Before inspecting the run relay, switch off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, disassemble the relay and pry apart the contacts. This should do the trick until you buy a replacement-- which you ought to do quickly.<p>
