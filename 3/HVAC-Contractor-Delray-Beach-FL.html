<h3>HVAC Repair Warnings You Should Not Ignore Delray Beach FL</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a federal government company, conducted a study in the 1990s to examine two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it reduces energy costs by enhancing airflow. After testing 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no substantial enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance airflow or energy efficiency. In some cases, measured particle levels in fact increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased immediately after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>There are numerous variables that contribute to indoor air contamination. Such aspects consist of using chemicals like formaldehyde in carpets and furniture; carbon monoxide given off by cigarette smoke and outdoors traffic; polychlorinated biphenyls contained in electrical transformers; radiation from building insulation; ozone from photo copiers; and solvents utilized in cleaners, glues, photo copiers; and the ventilation system itself.<p>

<p>I am extremely pleased with this company. Among my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the issue within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call service several years back and know the value of having the right parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also satisfied that he showed up at my house at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will absolutely be using Waycoff's again, and would advise them to everyone. Thank You very much.<p>
