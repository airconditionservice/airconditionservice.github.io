<p>These concepts-- and determination to suffer through the heat-- may currently be altering. Though just 33 percent of Seattle housing units had air conditioning in 2015, more than 46,000 new housing units have actually been integrated in the four years given that or are presently under construction.

Moisture management and humidity control might contravene efforts to attempt to optimize the operation to save energy. For example, moisture management and humidity control requires systems to be set to supply cosmetics air at lower temperatures (style levels), instead of the greater temperatures often used to save energy in cooling-dominated climate conditions.
