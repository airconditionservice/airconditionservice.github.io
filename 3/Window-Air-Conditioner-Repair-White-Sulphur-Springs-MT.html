He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour.

I'm also satisfied that he appeared at my home at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will absolutely be utilizing Waycoff's once again, and would recommend them to everyone. Thank You quite.<p>
