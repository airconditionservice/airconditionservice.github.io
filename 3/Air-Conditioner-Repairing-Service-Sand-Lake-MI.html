<h3>Frequent Causes of Air Conditioning Repair Calls in Sand Lake MI</h3>
<p>All contemporary air conditioning systems, even little window bundle systems, are geared up with internal air filters. These are generally of a lightweight gauze-like material, and should be changed or cleaned as conditions warrant. For instance, a building in a high dust environment, or a home with furry family pets, will need to have the filters changed more frequently than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as required will add to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in lost energy, shortened equipment life, and greater energy costs; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air flow. Additionally, extremely unclean or plugged filters can trigger overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
