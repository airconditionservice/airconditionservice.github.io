<p>It is still possible that an indoor air pollution problem exists if no contaminant sources are discovered. Excessive re-circulation of air results in "stale air" conditions. Stale air has greater levels of co2 and carbon monoxide gas (produced from human breathing and cigarette smoke, respectively) than outdoors air. Stale air might likewise be an issue when ventilation is not adequate to account for an increase in the number of employees in the location.<p>

Asbestos can cause lung cancer, meso-thelioma (a cancer of the chest and stomach linings), and asbestosis (permanent lung scarring that can be fatal). Symptoms of these illness do not show up till many years after direct exposure began. Many people with asbestos-related diseases were exposed to elevated concentrations on the job; some industrialized illness from exposure to clothes and equipment brought home from task websites.<p>
