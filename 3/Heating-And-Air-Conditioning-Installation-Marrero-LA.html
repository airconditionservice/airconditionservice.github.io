<p>All homes need efficient ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more typical than others. If your furnace kicks on however the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot burner has actually been stressed out from usage. Another possible factor could be a damaged thermostat, preventing the furnace from getting used to the correct temperature level. Furnaces that kick on frequently might be because of a dirty filter, which is not allowing the furnace to cycle air appropriately. If your furnace is making a great deal of racket when it switches on or is humming, there may be an internal problem. While humming is caused by a slipped belt in the internal workings, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled or even a dirty burner.<p>

You get instant, real-time access to the monitoring results by means of a control panel, which turns the information into visual charts that are easy to understand.<p>
