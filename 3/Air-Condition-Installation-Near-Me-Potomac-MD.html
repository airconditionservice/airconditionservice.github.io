<p>Right now, millions of dust mites, dead skin cells, building debris, and mold may be residing in your house's air ducts, affecting the air you breathe as well as the efficiency of your heating and a/c system.

Setting up a multi-split system develops more difficulties, considering that a few of indoor units can be situated far from the exterior. The very first designs of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not enable you to set the cooling individually for each space. Nevertheless, now the market has a broad selection of multi-split systems, in which the practical characteristics of indoor systems operate separately from each other.<p>
