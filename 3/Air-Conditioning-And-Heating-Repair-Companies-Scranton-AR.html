<p>Start by raising the lower sash, and then measure the height and width of the opening. When going shopping for an air conditioner to guarantee it'll fit comfortably into the window, be sure to have those measurements on hand.

<p>Have utilized the same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. When I have problems, they provide me priority and a lower rate. Bought a new primary unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever buy extended guarantees or service arrangements on anything however HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Great financial investment in my opinion. Never ever attempt to sell me something I do not require.<p>
