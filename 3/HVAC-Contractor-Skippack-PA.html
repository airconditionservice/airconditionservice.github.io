<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely used in dry cleaning. In laboratory research studies, it has been revealed to cause cancer in animals. Current studies suggest that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned products are kept and as they use dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning procedure so they can conserve cash by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical during the pressing and completing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to minimize your direct exposure to this chemical is sensible. Do not accept them until they have been appropriately dried if dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical smell when you choose them up. If goods with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent check outs, attempt a different dry cleaner.<p>

Plus, if the problem isnâ $ t properly diagnosed, altering a board wonâ $ t fix it, and boards are not returnable once installed. Itâ $ s wise to leave this repair to a pro to detect.<p>
