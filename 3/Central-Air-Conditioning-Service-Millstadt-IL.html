Jamey Stephens of Evergreen Home Heating and Energy has watched the single-family house installation company totally flip on its head the last few years. Winter season used to be the hectic season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summer, with their traditionally two-week AC installation wait times ballooning to as much as three months. It's been a cultural shift," says Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the climate and the people." And not simply with newbies more accustomed to AC living. Long time Seattle property owners are lastly giving up, he says, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit houses with air-cooling systems.<p>
<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Simply take a photo of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you may need a recommendation in the future). Then release the saved energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp ports must snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. If it's not, remove the adapter and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Protect the new capacitor (Photo 5) when you have actually switched all the wires.<p>
