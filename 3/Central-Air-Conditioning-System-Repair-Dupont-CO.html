<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may believe. Due to the fact that the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, low-cost flexible hose pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to wear and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>
<p>The installation was fast, professional and extremely well done. The installers were courteous and understood exactly what to do.

I very extremely recommend the two gentlemen as they are exceptional at what they do. Thank you to them as they certainly deserve my thanks and gratitude for a task well done.<p>

<p>As many of you discussed, preventative maintenance is required by all major devices manufacturer's to guarantee your factory warranties remain in location. Furthermore, the tangible outcomes of a PM is typically hard to quantify, as one response mentioned the cost savings in effectiveness or repairs that were avoided. A lot of pieces of a furnace or air conditioning unit don't just break at the breeze of a finger, but rather is the result of repeated use of a component that is out of balance. For instance, a heat exchanger may fail too soon due to the fact that the gas pressure was operating to high, cooking the metal and causing premature deterioration, resulting in holes and fractures. If that customer had received a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure remains in line and safeguards the element.  a very useful outcome and one that was no cost at the time of service, however one that possibly saved a client thousands.<p>
