PTACs, which are frequently used in hotels, have two different units (terminal packages), the evaporative system on the interior and the condensing unit on the exterior, with an opening travelling through the wall and linking them. This minimizes the interior system footprint and permits each space to be adjusted individually. PTAC systems might be adapted to provide heating in cold weather, either directly by using an electric strip, gas, or other heating system, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to heat the interior and draw heat from the exterior air, transforming the air conditioning system into a heatpump While space air conditioning offers optimum versatility, when used to cool lots of spaces at a time it is usually more expensive than central air conditioning.<p>
