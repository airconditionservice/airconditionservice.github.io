<p>Indoor contaminants. These include chemicals utilized in the building or remodelling of buildings (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning substances). In addition, appliances that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide Insufficient combustion and bad ventilation of these home appliances (cook ranges, gas furnaces, gas boilers, and gas hot water heater) can contribute to indoor contaminants. Gas cook tops need to be used with fans that send exhaust exterior. Gas-fired heating devices must be sealed and power-vented systems set up to get rid of products of incomplete combustion. Wood-burning ranges can also develop particulates and need to be vented outside.<p>
