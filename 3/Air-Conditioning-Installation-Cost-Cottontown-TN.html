(If the thermostat you acquire is already GFCI protected like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad should be GFCI secured.) However a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can trigger overloads and annoyance breaker journeys. For our bigger mat, we elected to install a dedicated circuit with its own electrical wiring and breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are available.<p>
