<p>The thermostat is the "heart" of your radiant heating system, controlling the power to the heating wires and likewise controling the temperature of the flooring. All electrical wiring for your radiant heat system either goes to it or from it. Many people will install their thermostat near the entrance of the room they are heating, near the light switches. However, anywhere you install it is fine as long as the area is unobstructed and dry.<p>
<p>An indoor air pollutant is a compound in the air that may affect the health of people who reside in the home.
