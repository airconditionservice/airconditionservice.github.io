Another popular feature to look for is a fan-only switch, which you can kick on at night to lower energy costs even more. Of course, more features mean higher central air conditioning costs.<p>
<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a requirement for air conditioning unit repair, which you need to watch out for. First, you ought to examine your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little ridiculous, but ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
