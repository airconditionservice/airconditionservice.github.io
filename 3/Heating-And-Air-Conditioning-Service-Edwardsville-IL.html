<h3>Home Air Conditioning Service in Edwardsville IL</h3>
<p>For a heated floor location less than 20 sq. ft., you might (for the most part) draw power from a nearby GFCI-protected outlet without overloading the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is currently GFCI safeguarded like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad should be GFCI safeguarded.) But a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can cause overloads and nuisance breaker journeys. For our bigger mat, we elected to set up a dedicated circuit with its own circuitry and circuit breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are offered.<p>
