<p>The instructions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfy finishing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the new breaker and final connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We recommend you do the very same. When the wiring is total, stimulate the system for a few minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable warms. Don't put the system into complete operation up until the thin-set and grout have had time to appropriately cure and solidify-- generally two to 4 weeks. Then call the household together and play a video game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm restroom flooring.<p>
