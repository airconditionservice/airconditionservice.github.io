<p>Air conditioning can also be offered by a procedure called complimentary cooling which uses pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is included due to the fact that the temperature level of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, thereby decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your car's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by circulating an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant flows. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator fails, the excess heat produced by the engine could harm the engine parts. To prevent this from occurring, have your radiator serviced regularly. To have your radiator requires managed by professionals, check out Eric's Garage today.<p>
