<h3>Things Every Homeowner Truth About Selecting Town Creek AL HVAC Companies</h3>
<p>Many people know that outside air contamination can impact their health, however indoor air pollution can likewise have considerable, hazardous result. EPA research studies of human direct exposure to air toxins show that indoor levels of contaminants may be 2 to five times-- and periodically more than 100 times-- higher than outside levels.

<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the demand to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
