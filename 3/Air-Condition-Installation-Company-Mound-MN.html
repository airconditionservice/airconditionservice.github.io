<p>Co2 concentrations increase as a result of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the buildup of co2 to quasi "constant state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. For that reason, measurements of carbon dioxide for functions of examining the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after an extended period of constant tenancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in offices a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable sign of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to determine carbon dioxide must be calibrated often, and outdoor measurements used for computations ought to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature results on measurements made outdoors might likewise be necessary.<p>
<p>Next, and perhaps simply as essential when it comes to central air conditioning costs, is the AC system's size.

Glycol piping and external heat exchangers ought to be insulated with fiberglass pipeline insulation. Duct tape can be utilized on the joints of the water piping insulation, and utilize the joint tape that includes fiberglass piping insulation. Insulation exposed to sunshine can be protected by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation utilized outside need to be safeguarded with PVC insulation covers.<p>
