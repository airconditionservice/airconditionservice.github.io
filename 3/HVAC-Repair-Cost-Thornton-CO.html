<p>As much of you pointed out, preventative maintenance is required by all major devices manufacturer's to guarantee your factory service warranties remain in location. Additionally, the tangible results of a PM is often difficult to measure, as one reaction specified the cost savings in performance or repairs that were prevented.

For instance, a heat exchanger might fail too soon since the gas pressure was running to high, cooking the metal and triggering premature degeneration, causing fractures and holes. If that client had actually received a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure stays in line and protects the element.  a very beneficial result and one that was no cost at the time of service, but one that possibly saved a client thousands.<p>
