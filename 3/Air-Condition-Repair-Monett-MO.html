The system runs silently and effectively, but to have 2 major elements stop working in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (defrost control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were listed on the billing prior to work started.

<p>Specific types of HVAC systems are a little more costly than wall systems, ceiling or cassette units are neatly concealed inside the ceiling in the classroom and are for that reason more discreet and visually pleasing to look at. They offer powerful air flow and are significantly more effective than standard wall systems and can, therefore, lower the variety of systems needed and this can lower installation and or replacement costs where multiple HVAC units are required. Ducted commercial-grade a/c systems are BETTER for the educational environment.
