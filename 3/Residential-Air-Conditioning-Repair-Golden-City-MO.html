<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't profitable you wouldn't use them.. Second of all like prolonged vehicle service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is actually sad.

The majority of companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to effectively service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Lastly found somebody to properly service and the system has actually been running issue free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
