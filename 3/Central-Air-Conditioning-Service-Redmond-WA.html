<p>If no impurity sources are found, it is still possible that an indoor air contamination problem exists. Excessive re-circulation of air results in "stagnant air" conditions. Stagnant air has higher levels of co2 and carbon monoxide (produced from human breathing and cigarette smoke, respectively) than outside air. When ventilation is not sufficient to account for an increase in the number of employees in the location, stagnant air may likewise be an issue.<p>

<p>It is not recommended that "regular" occupational direct exposure limitations (e.g., OELs, TLVs ®, PELs) be utilized to determine if the basic indoor air quality fulfills a specific standard. Occupational direct exposure limitations listed in health and safety guidelines and the Threshold Limitation Worths ® (TLVs) suggested by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) are intended as a guide to avoid disease or particular effects (like eye and nose irritation) in industrial scenarios. These limitations may not be suitable in workplace settings or for the house.<p>

<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is enabled to evaporate, hence the heat exchanger is typically called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it takes in heat from the within air, returns to the compressor, and duplicates the cycle. While doing so, heat is taken in from indoors and transferred outdoors, resulting in cooling of the building.<p>
