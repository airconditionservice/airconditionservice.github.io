They are likewise commonly referred to as "reverse cycle a/c unit".

Portable instruments utilized to measure co2 need to be calibrated frequently, and outdoor measurements used for computations ought to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature results on measurements made outdoors might likewise be required.<p>
