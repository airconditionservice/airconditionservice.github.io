<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high performances, and are often integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summer a/c. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heatpump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in since the storage serves as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (instead of charging) mode, causing the temperature to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>

<h3>How to Keep Healthy Ductwork for A Healthy Home in Forest Knolls CA</h3>
<p>We discovered Jake and Adam to be delightful, and were very pleased that someone as knowledgeable as Adam had the ability to repair the air and return conditioner.

Our pointer to any property buyers: hire Blue Flame to check the air conditioner prior to you buy. We purchased this home in February, so it was too cold to switch on the AC then, but Adam stated he had ways to test AC systems even in winter. We wish we had known him then.<p>
