After checking 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study discovered that there was no significant enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy performance. In some cases, measured particle levels in fact increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased right away after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>

A voided warranty will not do you any excellent should the system fail or breakdown. Do it right from the start and work with a certified person with the experience to set up the system.<p>
