<p>Indoor pollutants. These consist of chemicals used in the building and construction or renovation of structures (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning substances). In addition, home appliances that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide gas Incomplete combustion and poor ventilation of these appliances (cook ranges, gas heating systems, gas boilers, and gas hot water heater) can add to indoor pollutants. Gas cook tops must be used with fans that send exhaust outside. Gas-fired heating devices need to be sealed and power-vented systems installed to remove products of insufficient combustion. Wood-burning ranges can likewise produce particulates and need to be vented outside.<p>
