As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is triggered, and the air conditioning system has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The air conditioning unit's power consumption will increase by 50 W to make up for this, thus making the 100 W heating element cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
