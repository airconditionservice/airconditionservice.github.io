Incorrectly situated outside air intake vents can likewise generate air infected with vehicle and truck exhaust, boiler emissions, fumes from dumpsters, or air vented from toilets. Lastly, ventilation systems can be a source of in door pollution themselves by spreading biological contaminants that have multiplied in cooling towers, humidifiers, dehumidifiers, ac system, or the inside surfaces of ventilation duct.<p>
