<p>My eldest child constantly complained about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a brand-new one. For a long time I dismissed him but then I realized that it truly didnâ $ t distribute air like it did previously. Weâ $ ve had the thing for 16 years so I didnâ $ t really think about anything else other than replacing it. The one I got deserves every cent. The sound level is itâ and low $ s great on energy conserving too.<p>
