<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is frequently in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps end up being inefficient in more severe cold. This is because ice forms on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system need to temporarily change back into the regular a/c mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
