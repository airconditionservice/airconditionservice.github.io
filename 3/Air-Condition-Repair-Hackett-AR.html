All 5 other companies quoted me with different prices and different problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth individual, who discussed to me completely the issues which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental house, another event. When I called and he advised me to contact warranty which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the system working once again, he helped me difficulty shoot the concern. He is sincere, reputable, and sensible on price. It's tough to find an honest AC guy and I'm grateful I discovered Luis. Highly suggest Luis and his company.<p>
