<p>When the heat pump headed out in our workplaces, Taylor at Integrity was very useful in collecting information on the phone and offering clear guidelines about how to temporarily cope with the problem and prepare the heat pump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was remarkably effective and provided clear communication about the issue, its remedies, and its future avoidance. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was expert and friendly. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will certainly use Stability Energy Systems again, for workplace and house.<p>
<p>It might be time to clean the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils won't offer off heat efficiently and will keep the system running if the AC doesn't turn off.

Prior to inspecting the run relay, turn off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, take apart the relay and pry apart the contacts. This need to suffice till you purchase a replacement-- which you must do soon.<p>
