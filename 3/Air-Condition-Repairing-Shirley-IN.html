Dust and dander are well-known for decreasing the air quality in your house, but there are numerous other pollutants that can not just unclean up the air, but lead to other health problems. Radon and carcinogens from cleaning materials and building products contribute to bad air quality, and can also trigger cancers.

The particles themselves are different sizes, but the ones to be most concerned about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller sized-- since they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outside PM, created by construction, for example, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, enters into buildings via natural and mechanical ventilation.
