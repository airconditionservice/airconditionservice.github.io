<p>It prevails to presume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable over time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a structure as fairly the same physical product in time. In truth, the true nature of buildings can be deemed the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be explained and understood as intricate systems. Research applying the methods ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment considering the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
