<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel often gets ask for consultation and support in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal firms. During the 1970s, lots of homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation measure. However, a lot of these houses were discovered to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this product. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was installed several years ago are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely used in dry cleaning. In laboratory studies, it has actually been shown to trigger cancer in animals.

<p>Have actually utilized the same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. They offer me priority and a lower rate when I have concerns. Bought a brand-new main system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever buy prolonged warranties or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Great investment in my viewpoint. Never attempt to sell me something I do not require.<p>
