<p>Fact: Geothermal systems actually consume no water. If an aquifer is utilized to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is gone back to that exact same aquifer. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that lost the water after passing over the heat exchanger, but those are extremely unusual now. When used commercially, geothermal HVAC systems really eliminate millions of gallons of water that would otherwise have been evaporated in cooling towers in standard systems.<p>
<p>Energy efficiency can be enhanced much more in central heating systems by presenting zoned heating. This enables a more granular application of heat, similar to non-central heater. Zones are managed by several thermostats. In water heater the thermostats manage zone valves, and in forced air systems they control zone dampers inside the vents which selectively block the circulation of air. In this case, the control system is really crucial to preserving a proper temperature level.<p>

<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider because the 2 specialists I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
