<h3>High Efficiency Furnace in Houston TX</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you might think. Due to the fact that many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive flexible tube) instead of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to use and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
<p>An automobile's coolant system transfers excess heat from one part of the engine and lastly loses it through the radiator fins. With time, the coolant becomes dirty and old.

A coolant flush is fundamental maintenance for your automobile's cooling system. Call 206-523-2133 or check out Acme Auto Electric & Repair in Seattle, WA 98103 for all your coolant system flush and fill needs.<p>
