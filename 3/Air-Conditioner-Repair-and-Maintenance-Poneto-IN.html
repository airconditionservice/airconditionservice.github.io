<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) refers to air quality in indoor workplace, class or lab environments, rather than outdoor or industrial settings. In jobs where union subscription is not a problem, an HVAC technician may finish the assembly and installation of the ductwork that distributes the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system.

In numerous split-system a/c, this indoor cabinet also contains a furnace or the indoor part of a heatpump.

If your house currently has a furnace but no air conditioner, a split-system is the most affordable central air conditioner to install.<p>
