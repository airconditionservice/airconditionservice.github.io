<p>Central air units are measured in lots. This measurement is based on the unit's ability to cool your home. For instance, a 1 heap unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 increase in loads, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This implies a 4.5 lot unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't knowledgeable about the term BTU, it implies the quantity of energy needed to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F °.<p>

We would highly motivate others to go right to Berkshire Heating and Air Conditioning for all their heating and cooling needs.<p>
<p>Central air is a luxury not everyone can pay for, a lot of Seattleites need to discover methods to fight the heat without a duct system. Last year the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in reaction to a heat advisory from the National Weather Service.
