<h3>Ductless Air Conditioning For Newburg MO Homes With No Air Ducts</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Loan and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a government firm, performed a study in the 1990s to investigate 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it minimizes energy costs by enhancing air flow. After testing 33 houses in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no substantial improvement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not enhance airflow or energy efficiency. Sometimes, measured particle levels actually increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced immediately after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>There are several variables that add to indoor air pollution. Such elements consist of making use of chemicals like formaldehyde in carpets and furniture; carbon monoxide given off by cigarette smoke and outside traffic; polychlorinated biphenyls included in electrical transformers; radiation from building insulation; ozone from photo copiers; and solvents used in cleaners, glues, photo copiers; and the ventilation system itself.<p>
