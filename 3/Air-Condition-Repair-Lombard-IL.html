<p>Aerating or ventilation (the "V" in HVAC) is the procedure of replacing or exchanging air in any area to supply high indoor air quality which includes temperature control, oxygen replenishment, and removal of moisture, odors, smoke, heat, dust, airborne germs, carbon dioxide, and other gases. Ventilation eliminates undesirable smells and excessive moisture, introduces outdoors air, keeps interior structure air circulating, and prevents stagnation of the interior air.<p>
<p>Because an ac system moves heat in between the outside coil and the indoor coil, both must be kept clean. This means that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also essential to regularly clean the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser tidy will ultimately lead to harm to the compressor, since the condenser coil is responsible for discharging both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat generated by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
