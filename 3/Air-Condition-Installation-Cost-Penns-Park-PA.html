<h3>Selecting Commercial HVAC Repair Services at Penns Park PA</h3>
<p>Specific instant effects are similar to those from colds or other viral diseases, so it is often tough to determine if the symptoms are an outcome of direct exposure to indoor air pollution.

If the symptoms fade or go away when an individual is far from the area, for example, an effort ought to be made to determine indoor air sources that may be possible causes.

<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outside air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the demand to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (generally cooled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
