<p>Individuals working in buildings with bad IAQ may observe musty or undesirable smells or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about symptoms that occur at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more serious issue. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been connected to IAQ issues. If you have signs that are not disappearing or are worsening, talk with your medical professional about them. However not all direct exposures cause symptoms, so there is no alternative to excellent building management.<p>
<p>It prevails to assume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable with time. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the frustrating bulk of the mass of product in a building as relatively unchanged physical product gradually. In reality, the real nature of buildings can be viewed as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be explained and understood as complex systems. Research applying the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of communities can assist increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the developed environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
