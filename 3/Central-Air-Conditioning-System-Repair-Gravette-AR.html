<p>Free cooling systems can have very high performances, and are in some cases combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summer season a/c. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heatpump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in since the storage serves as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (instead of charging) mode, causing the temperature level to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>

<p>An indoor air contaminant is a substance in the air that might impact the health of individuals who reside in the home. Toxins could come from outside the home-- such as an idling automobile engine in a connected garage, yard garbage burning, or radon entering your house from the ground below. An air pollutant might also come from inside the home-- such as carbon monoxide from a malfunctioning furnace, unstable organic compounds (VOCs) from a freshly painted space, pre-owned smoke, mold growing on damp or moist carpeting, or chemicals from hobbies, home cleaning, or personal care products. Viruses and germs, pet dander, and pest parts (allergen or roaches) are other possible indoor air toxins.<p>
<p>Weatherization typically does not trigger indoor air issues by adding brand-new pollutants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can often produce toxins.) However, measures such as setting up storm windows, weather condition removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can reduce the amount of outside air infiltrating into a house. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Examples of non-friable asbestos products consist of vinyl asbestos floor tiles, acoustic ceiling tiles, and asbestos cement items. These products present a threat just when they are dealt with in a way that produces dust including asbestos fibers which can be breathed in. When asbestos-containing materials are harmed or disrupted by repair, remodeling, or demolition activities, tiny fibers can become airborne if correct controls are not in location. This can result in the potential for significant health issue.<p>
