<p>As a number of you mentioned, preventative maintenance is needed by all significant equipment producer's to guarantee your factory guarantees remain in location. Furthermore, the concrete outcomes of a PM is frequently tough to measure, as one response mentioned the savings in effectiveness or repairs that were avoided.
