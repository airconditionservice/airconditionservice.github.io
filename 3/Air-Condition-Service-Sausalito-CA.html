<p>We tend to consider air contamination as something outside - haze, ozone, or smog hanging in the air, especially in summer. These convection heaters are still extensively utilized and are normally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or gas, but some are electrically powered also.<p>
