<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to offer your house that perfect temperature level throughout the year. But while they're cycling through all that air, they're straining some of those typical air contaminants. Eventually, their air filters fill and stop doing their job. Not just does that cause difficulty for your indoor air quality, it also uses down your AC system, which can lead to pricey repairs down the roadway. So, make certain to change your AC filters routinely, or get a cooling service strategy which normally includes a filter change - specifically if you are allergy-prone or live in a city with high levels of contamination.<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, humid air from your home's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil absorbs heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is circulated back into your home. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface of the evaporator coil as liquid water, dripping into a pan listed below. From the pan, the water streams into a drain tube which is usually routed into a basement flooring drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>
