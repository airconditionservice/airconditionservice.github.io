<p>Indoor impurities. These include chemicals utilized in the building and construction or renovation of buildings (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning substances). In addition, devices that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide Insufficient combustion and bad ventilation of these devices (cook stoves, gas heaters, gas boilers, and gas water heaters) can contribute to indoor impurities. Gas cook tops should be utilized with fans that send out exhaust outside. Gas-fired heating devices must be sealed and power-vented systems set up to get rid of products of insufficient combustion. Wood-burning stoves can also produce particulates and must be vented outside.<p>
<p>A 3rd method to decide whether your house might have bad indoor air quality is to take a look at your lifestyle and activities. Human activities can be considerable sources of indoor air pollution. Lastly, try to find indications of issues with the ventilation in your home. Signs that can indicate your house might not have enough ventilation include moisture condensation on windows or walls, smelly or stuffy air, dirty central heating and air cooling devices, and areas where books, shoes, or other items end up being musty. To detect odors in your house, action outside for a few minutes, and then upon reentering your house, note whether odors are noticeable.<p>
<p>Have used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. They provide me top priority and a lower rate when I have concerns. Purchased a new main system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never purchase prolonged service warranties or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Good financial investment in my viewpoint. Never ever try to sell me something I don't need.<p>
