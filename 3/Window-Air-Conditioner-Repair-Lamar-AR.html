<p>My oldest son constantly complained about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a new one. For some time I dismissed him however then I realized that it really didnâ $ t distribute air like it did before. Weâ $ ve had the thing for 16 years so I didnâ $ t actually consider anything else except changing it. The one I got deserves every penny. The sound level is itâ and low $ s terrific on energy conserving too.<p>
<p>I called Snowflake Air since my furnace was not working. Jose and his assistant arrived on time. Jose hung out repairing the issue, all the while explaining whatever to me. After finding the thermostat was not working appropriately. He had to go get the appropriate replacement. After the installation of the brand-new thermostat, Jose explained the operation and programing to me. I will certainly utilize Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
