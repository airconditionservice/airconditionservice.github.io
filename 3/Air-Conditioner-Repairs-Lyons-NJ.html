Due to the fact that the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, low-cost versatile hose pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to use and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
