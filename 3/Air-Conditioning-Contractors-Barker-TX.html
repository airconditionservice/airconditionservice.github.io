<p>Air conditioning can likewise be supplied by a process called complimentary cooling which uses pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heatpump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added because the temperature of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, thus decreasing its effectiveness.<p>

<p>Biological impurities consist of bacteria, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and cat saliva, home dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are numerous sources of these toxins. Pollens originate from plants; infections are transmitted by individuals and animals; germs are carried by individuals, animals, and soil and plant debris; and home family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a powerful irritant. It can become air-borne when it dries. Infected central air conditioning handling systems can become breeding premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological impurities and can then disperse these contaminants through the house.<p>
