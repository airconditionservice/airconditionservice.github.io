<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier because the two professionals I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

Anticipate the average mobile home oil furnace to have starting expenses of around $1,500.
