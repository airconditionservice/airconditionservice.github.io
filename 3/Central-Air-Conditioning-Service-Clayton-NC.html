For example, he might seal gaps and fractures in the outer walls and attic flooring, or he may blow insulation into the walls, either of which might knock as much as 30% off your heating & cooling expenses.

<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most typical mix utilized in vehicles in the U.S. till 1994, when most styles changed to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting potential of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer produced in the U.S. for this type of application, but is still imported and can be acquired and used by certified HVAC professionals. For systems needing only a periodic "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in great working order and performing far much better than virtually all "R-134a" systems whether "transformed" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is considered "low-cost" by numerous people.<p>
