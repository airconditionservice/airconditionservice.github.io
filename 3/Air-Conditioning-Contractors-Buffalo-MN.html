<p>I am changing our High Speed System due to the fact that of a major refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11. The installer will be utilizing the above noted devices, a Carrier, Comfort Series Single Stage Condenser, 31,000 BTUs. They are also installing an Unico single Phase Blower module, and a Unico Evaporator Coil, 31,000 BTUs and a 12 SEER. They will be including three (3) high velocity supply lines and recycle the existing 17 supply lines. They will likewise reuse the refrigerant lines and leave the R-11 refrigerant and replace with a R410 refrigerant. They will also install a Honeywell 5000 programmable cooling thermostat. I also have a choice for an additional $2,818.00 to install a Carrier Efficiency Series two-stage condenser (31,000 BTUs and a 14 SEER); a Unico two-stage blower module and a Unico R-410 Evaporator Coil module that are both rated at 14 SEER and are 31,000 BTUs.<p>
<p>Some biological pollutants set off allergic reactions, consisting of hypersensitivity pneumonitis, hay fever, and some kinds of asthma. Transmittable diseases, such as influenza, measles, and chicken pox are transferred through the air. Molds and mildews launch disease-causing contaminants. Signs of illness brought on by biological toxins include sneezing, watery eyes, coughing, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, lethargy, fever, and digestion problems.<p>
<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is often in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heatpump become ineffective in more extreme cold. This is because ice kinds on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system must temporarily switch back into the regular cooling mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered just in this mode in order to make up for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
