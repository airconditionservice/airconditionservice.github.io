<h3>How Do Air Heat Pump Works in Lafayette NJ?</h3>
<p>A lot of residential heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The current trend in home building and construction is to minimize air leakage through cracks and other openings in walls, roofings, and floorings. The combination of these construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has led to a boost in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) suggests that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor makeup air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living areas of residential structures. The ASHRAE standards for makeup air for bathroom and kitchens in houses are much greater. This fresh makeup air dilutes indoor impurities and helps tire them from the home.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He made the effort to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was educated and courteous. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
