<p>If it's time to upgrade an aging AC, variable speed is the way to go. Already planning to change an existing a/c unit? Presuming your spending plan accommodates a variable speed system, you must certainly get one! You'll feel more comfortable throughout the summer months, and your indoor air will be whole lot cleaner. At the very least, think about a 2 phase compressor for enhanced convenience and effectiveness.<p>
<p>We recommend utilizing our insulation boards when setting up over concrete slabs. Warmup Insulation Boards will save you money when used in combination with underfloor heating by acting as a really efficient thermal barrier. They shows the heat upwards into the floor tile instead of permitting heat to heat up the concrete piece listed below. By utilizing Warmup Insulation Boards you will discover that after turning on your heating, your flooring tiles will warm up in about 10-15 minutes. Without insulation boards it could take anything from 2-3 hours, or more.<p>
<p>If the AC doesn't switch off, it may be time to clean up the condensing uni t Dirty condenser coils will not emit heat efficiently and will keep the system running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay may have welded together-- something that can take place gradually because of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to checking the run relay, shut off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, take apart the relay and pry apart the contacts. This must work until you purchase a replacement-- which you need to do soon.<p>
