<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may think. Due to the fact that many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive versatile hose pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to use and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
