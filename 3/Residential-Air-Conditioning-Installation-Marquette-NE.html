Wetness management and humidity control may contravene efforts to attempt to enhance the operation to conserve energy.

However, for the majority of the United States and numerous parts of Europe and Japan, during the majority of hours of the year, outside air temperature levels are cool enough that the air does not require additional cooling to provide thermal comfort inside.

This decreases the interior system footprint and enables each room to be adjusted individually. PTAC systems might be adapted to offer heating in winter, either directly by using an electric strip, gas, or other heating unit, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to heat the interior and draw heat from the exterior air, transforming the a/c unit into a heat pump While space cooling offers optimum flexibility, when used to cool lots of spaces at a time it is normally more expensive than central air conditioning.<p>
