Loose, malfunctioning or missing wires will trigger the thermostat to lose its connection to the system and interrupt service. Part of preserving your furnace includes examining the advised connections along with temperature level and pressure evaluates. Take some time to check these parts for dust and damage, making certain that they are tight and safe and secure.<p>

<p>I am extremely amazed with this company. Among my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the problem within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour.
