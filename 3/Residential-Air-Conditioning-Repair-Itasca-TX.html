<p>Current Review: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and well-informed. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
