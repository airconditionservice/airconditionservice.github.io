<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently gets requests for consultation and help in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal agencies. During the 1970s, numerous property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation step. However, many of these houses were discovered to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this product. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was set up many years back are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

Change the filter if the blower is running but no heat is coming out. A filthy filter also triggers soot buildup on the heat exchanger, decreasing the effectiveness of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>
