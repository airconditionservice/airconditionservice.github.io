<p>We're Not Just Another Air Duct Cleaning and HVAC Service Company. Building-Related Disease (BRI) describes less frequent (but typically more serious) cases of individuals becoming ill after being in a particular building at a certain time. In these cases, there is normally a similar set of clinical symptoms experienced by the individuals and a clear cause can often be found upon investigation. Legionnaires Illness is an example of BRI triggered by germs which can pollute a building's cooling system.<p>
<p>When trying to figure out how often I should replace my air conditioning filters, there are numerous things to take into factor to consider. Every Houston Heights 77007 77008 home has an unique DNA on how it accumulates dust and dirt. It takes about 6 months of close observation to see how frequently your air conditioning filter collects dirt and dust. After that, you can make a much better right decision on how typically your HVAC filters need replacing. Some Houston Midtown 77003 77004 houses have more than one HVAC filter, like townhouses. The more air filters you have in your Houston Galleria 77055 77056 77057 house, the less typically you'll have to clean them. Houston Montrose 77006 77098 houses with only one a/c filter require changing more frequently.<p>

<p>Exposure Control: Changing the time and location of contaminant exposure. An example of time control is scheduling floor waxing and removing (with the ventilation system functioning) on a Friday. This allows items to off-gas over the weekend while the majority of the personnel are at house over the weekend. Place control includes moving the contaminant source far from occupants and even transferring vulnerable residents.<p>
<p>Moisture management and humidity control requires running HVAC systems as designed. Wetness management and humidity control may conflict with efforts to attempt to optimize the operation to save energy. For example, moisture management and humidity control requires systems to be set to provide make-up air at lower temperatures (design levels), instead of the greater temperature levels sometimes utilized to conserve energy in cooling-dominated environment conditions. However, for most of the US and lots of parts of Europe and Japan, throughout the majority of hours of the year, outdoor air temperatures are cool enough that the air does not require further cooling to provide thermal comfort indoors. Nevertheless, high humidity outdoors produces the need for careful attention to humidity levels inside. High humidities generate mold development and wetness inside your home is related to a greater frequency of resident breathing problems.<p>
<p>There's no getting away that all devices ages with time. However that doesn't imply that older chillers can not gain from mechanical upgrades.

Our solutions are created to provide lower energy expenses, lessen mechanical wear and extend equipment life.<p>
