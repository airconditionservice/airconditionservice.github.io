<p>Prior to you go out and buy an air conditioning system, there are a few things to choose initially. Where are you going to be setting up the air conditioning unit?

Too big and you'll encounter issues with short-cycling, which can damage the air conditioning unit and reduce its life.

<p>A packaged system, usually set up on the roof, is most commonly used on commercial structures, but it is likewise a choice for house owners to consider. Many times, these systems contain not only the air conditioning system itself but also a furnace. A benefit of this unit is undoubtedly the cost. Packaged units are excellent for those wanting to save money on the installation of a brand-new heating and cooling system individually, given that the unit is integrated. However, one con is that these systems are usually just available for bigger homes due to their high power and capacity. In addition, while they can be a good way to conserve money on a complete HVAC system, they're still significantly more costly than purchasing just a cooling system. Therefore, this may not be the very best option for house owners looking for short-term cost savings or those with smaller sized budgets.<p>
