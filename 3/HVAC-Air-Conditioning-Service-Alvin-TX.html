<p>For a heated floor area less than 20 sq. ft., you could (in most cases) draw power from a surrounding GFCI-protected outlet without straining the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is currently GFCI protected like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad need to be GFCI protected.) However a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can trigger overloads and nuisance breaker trips. For our larger mat, we chose to install a devoted circuit with its own wiring and circuit breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are readily available.<p>
