<p>I am really satisfied with this company. Among my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the problem within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call organisation several years earlier and understand the value of having the ideal parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also satisfied that he appeared at my house at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will absolutely be using Waycoff's again, and would recommend them to everybody. Thank You very much.<p>
