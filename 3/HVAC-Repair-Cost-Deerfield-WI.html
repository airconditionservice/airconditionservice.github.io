<p>The results of lead direct exposure on fetuses and children can be severe. They include delays in physical and psychological advancement, lower IQ levels, shortened attention spans, and increased behavioral issues. Fetuses, infants, and kids are more susceptible to lead exposure than grownups because lead is more easily soaked up into growing bodies, and the tissues of children are more sensitive to the destructive impacts of lead. Kids might have higher direct exposures given that they are more likely to get lead dust on their hands and after that put their fingers or other lead-contaminated items into their mouths.<p>

More serious than many allergenic homes is the ability of mold to set off episodes face to faces that already have asthma, a severe respiratory disease.<p>

You may likewise wish to seek advice from a board-certified specialist or an occupational medicine expert for responses to your questions.<p>
