<p>I normally do not leave reviews however wished to share my experience. You don't anticipate needing to replace your AC system. Regrettably for us, we had no other alternative. What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long way. Other companies would arrange a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert discussing my alternatives. After business hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and discuss choices. I arranged my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a household buddy and now I will suggest this company to my friends.<p>
