<p>Reality: Geothermal systems really consume no water. If an aquifer is used to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is returned to that same aquifer. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that squandered the water after passing over the heat exchanger, however those are exceptionally uncommon now. When used commercially, geothermal HVAC systems really remove millions of gallons of water that would otherwise have been evaporated in cooling towers in traditional systems.<p>
<p>Free cooling systems can have really high effectiveness, and are often combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summer season air conditioning. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in due to the fact that the storage serves as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (instead of charging) mode, triggering the temperature to slowly increase during the cooling season.<p>
<p>A geothermal heater is more reliable than options, and is not affected by any external factors, unlike other renewable resources such as wind energy and solar power.

Geothermal heating depends on neither the sun nor the wind, however instead takes its heat from the earth's crust, which is constantly hot.
