<p>G&S did an outstanding job installing our brand-new furnace and AC unit. The best aspect of G&S is that they service warranty for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace stopped working within a number of months (no fault of G&S). Manufacturers service warranty would cover the parts cost but G&S fixed and covered labor cost under their warranty. Also they detected the issue and fixed really quickly. Absolutely A++ installation and service.<p>
<p>My eldest child always complained about how the AC was run-down and we required to get a brand-new one. For some time I dismissed him however then I realized that it really didnâ $ t distribute air like it did before. Weâ $ ve had the thing for 16 years so I didnâ $ t truly consider anything else other than replacing it. The one I got deserves every cent. The noise level is itâ and low $ s great on energy saving too.<p>
