<h3>AC Maintenance Cost in Palm PA</h3>
<p>My house has 5 systems, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" discovered something wrong with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned up for an extra $30.00. (He actually stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I grumbled and got a refund) When this guy belittled me for my "not understanding", I threw him off the property.<p>

<p>I had a horrible experience with an HVAC company that charged $8,519 for installing a furnace cost $1,300. Additionally, the company used 98% of the existing product bought with your home. This company presented a service agreement contract to provide service to heating, electrical and plumbing. Throughout the assessment on a really cold day they eliminated the furnace claiming health risk reason and contractor laws for their choice. As a new property owner I have learned how to determine the sincere HVAC company vs the HVAC snakes.<p>

<p>Sean was really valuable. He is a really enjoyable individual to deal with. No pressure used to buy additional things. Answered all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put surge protectors on the unit and do the complete maintenance on the system. that was to make certain they were no problems other than the blower motor. Since there was not one on hand, the only reason he could not install the new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he knows for sure what the issue is.<p>
