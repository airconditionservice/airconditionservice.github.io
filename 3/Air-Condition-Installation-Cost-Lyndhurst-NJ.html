<p>Right now, countless dust mites, dead skin cells, building particles, and mold may be residing in your house's duct, affecting the air you breathe along with the performance of your heating and cooling system. Indoor air quality isn't on the majority of people's radar. Only 9 percent of Americans consider it a threat to their health, and 70 percent aren't concerned about it at all, according to a current study by the Customer Reports National Proving Ground.

<p>Moisture management and humidity control needs operating HVAC systems as designed. Moisture management and humidity control may contravene efforts to attempt to optimize the operation to conserve energy. For instance, moisture management and humidity control requires systems to be set to provide makeup air at lower temperature levels (style levels), instead of the greater temperature levels in some cases used to conserve energy in cooling-dominated climate conditions. Nevertheless, for the majority of the US and many parts of Europe and Japan, during the majority of hours of the year, outside air temperature levels are cool enough that the air does not require additional cooling to supply thermal comfort inside your home.

<p>Due to the fact that they remove moisture from the air, Air conditioners can produce a lot of water. To get rid of this, they have a generally plastic drain pipeline that comes out of the side of the air handler. In time, algae can obstruct this pipe and, when it does, the AC won't work. In fact, some condensate drains pipes have a float switch that will not let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can likewise puddle around the system or flood the area.
