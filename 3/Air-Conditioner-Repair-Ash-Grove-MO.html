<p>Fact: Geothermal systems really take in no water. If an aquifer is utilized to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is returned to that exact same aquifer. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that lost the water after passing over the heat exchanger, but those are extremely rare now. When used commercially, geothermal HVAC systems actually get rid of countless gallons of water that would otherwise have actually been vaporized in cooling towers in conventional systems.<p>
<p>Some health results may appear shortly after a single exposure or repeated exposures to a pollutant. These include irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, lightheadedness, and tiredness. Such instant impacts are treatable and typically short-term. Often the treatment is just removing the individual's direct exposure to the source of the pollution, if it can be recognized. Soon after exposure to some indoor air pollutants, signs of some diseases such as asthma might appear, be worsened or aggravated.<p>
<p>Property owners might likewise presume that since a glowing flooring heating system can be viewed (and funded) as a home enhancement, its installation will instantly raise their house's worth.
