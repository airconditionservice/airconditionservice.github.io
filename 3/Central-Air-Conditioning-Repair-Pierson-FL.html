<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds incredible, however furnace professionals frequently discover that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be turned on.

<p>The modeling efforts consist of the development and application of multizone air flow and indoor air quality designs, particularly the CONTAM series which forecasts air flows and contaminant concentrations in multizone structure systems.

CONTAM has been utilized at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transportation in large residential, workplace, and school buildings.<p>
