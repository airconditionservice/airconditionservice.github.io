<p>A specific a/c unit that is utilized only for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also utilizes a refrigeration cycle, however differs from a basic a/c because both the evaporator and the condenser are placed in the same air course. Because its condenser coil releases heat outside, a standard air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the room. However, given that all parts of the dehumidifier remain in the exact same room, no heat energy is gotten rid of. Rather, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier stays in the space as heat, so the space is actually heated up, simply as by an electric heater that draws the exact same amount of power.<p>
