<p>Last week, Target told reporters at The Wall Street Journal and Reuters that the initial intrusion into its systems was traced back to network credentials that were taken from a third party vendor. Sources now tell KrebsOnSecurity that the supplier in question was a heating, air and refrigeration  conditioning subcontractor that has worked at a number of locations at Target and other top sellers.<p>
