<p>If you believe a mold issue-- either since of visible growth or a moldy odor regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much excellent if it does not get rid of the mold.

Leaking return ducts can likewise introduce moisture. Once again, if you believe a mold problem, think about having a service company check the duct system for leakages.<p>
