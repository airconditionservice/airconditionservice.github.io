A radiator cools the engine by flowing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation.

When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine could damage the engine components. To avoid this from occurring, have your radiator serviced regularly. To have your radiator needs managed by experts, go to Acme Automobile Electric & Repair today.<p>
