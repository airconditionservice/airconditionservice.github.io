<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Well-maintained heating equipment can last for several years.

<p>If you presume a mold issue-- either since of noticeable growth or a moldy smell consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much excellent if it doesn't eliminate the mold. Mold begins with a wetness problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can preserve and check. Dripping return ducts can also introduce wetness. Again, if you think a mold issue, consider having a service company examine the duct system for leaks.<p>

Throughout high usage months, inspect the filters at least month-to-month.<p>
