<p>In a common residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar earned to his employees, equipment expenses, marketing, energies, and other costs prior to paying himself anything. Usually this leaves about 6% of revenues to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This doesn't sound like much, especially if the goal of owning a company was for monetary freedom. Plus, this 6% is after the few years it required to build the business and not taking an income as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% usually isn't completion objective. HVAC company owner should strive for 10-15% by cutting expenses in some locations or increasing their earnings while keeping costs the same in all other areas.<p>
