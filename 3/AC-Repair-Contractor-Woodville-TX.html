<p>The instructions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfy completing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the new breaker and last connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrician. We recommend you do the same. Once the electrical wiring is complete, energize the system for a couple of minutes to make certain the controls work and resistance cable heats.
