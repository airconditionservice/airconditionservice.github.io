<p>Wow - just wow. I never ever have heard of the $5000 rule but got ta provide whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one inside your home and never ever needs maintenance and one outdoors and requires annual or even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to purchase stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up rather than purchase something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are simply insane and all over the location and I guess they understand they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
