These invisible electro-magnetic infrared waves radiate out from a warmed thermal mass. In a consisted of system like a home, the warmer objects naturally heat the cooler ones until a balance is achieved.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is normally an absence of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is brought on by a plugged filter. Without air flow, moisture from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Turn off the AC unit, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and try once again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, because something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
