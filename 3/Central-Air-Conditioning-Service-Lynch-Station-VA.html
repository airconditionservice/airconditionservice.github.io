<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Heating is the largest energy cost in the average home. In very dry climates, evaporative coolers, in some cases referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during heat. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a wet pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature of the inbound air is reduced, however it is also more damp, so the overall heat (practical heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. A few of the practical heat of the entering air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the going into air is dry enough, the results can be rather substantial.<p>
<p>For instance, pollutants may gather within the air diffusers and grills, introducing pollutants into the environment. Or if the outside air consumption lies near a source of wetness or other outside toxin, it may function as a path to bring the contaminants inside. Or the ventilation system might not be working as well as it needs to-- if particles is blocking the outside air intake, for example, or the filters are infected or badly preserved.<p>
