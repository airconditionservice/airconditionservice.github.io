A ductless unit has a built-in efficiency advantage due to the fact that up to 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC system might be lost to leakages in your ducts. Ductless heat pumps are great for additions since they don't require any new ductwork to be set up. Because a system is installed in each room or area you want to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature of each zone, which can conserve energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensors that immediately raise the temperature in the space when you exist.<p>
