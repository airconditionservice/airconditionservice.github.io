Due to the fact that many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive flexible pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to use and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
<p>Air conditioning can likewise be offered by a process called free cooling which utilizes pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled space.

Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is included because the temperature level of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, thereby decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
