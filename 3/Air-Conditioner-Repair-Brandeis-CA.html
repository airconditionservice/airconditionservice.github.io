<p>The majority of central air conditioning conditioners are connected to a home's forced-air distribution system. Hence, the same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to disperse cool air from the air conditioning system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is operating, hot air inside the house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your house. When the a/c works however your house doesn't cool, the problem is probably in the distribution system.<p>

<p>On the interior, warm, humid air from your home's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil soaks up heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is circulated back into your house. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface area of the evaporator coil as liquid water, dripping into a pan listed below. From the pan, the water streams into a drain tube which is typically routed into a basement flooring drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>
