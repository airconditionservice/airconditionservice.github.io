<p>Although commercial geothermal systems have been in presence since the mid-90s, and the idea established much earlier than that, its application in houses is still fairly brand-new.

<p>We're spending a lot more time inside your home, these days. While many individuals assume pollution is simply an outside issue, your house (and office) can likewise be polluted.

The ASHRAE guidelines for cosmetics air for bathroom and kitchens in homes are much higher. This fresh make-up air waters down indoor pollutants and assists tire them from the house.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is typically an absence of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without air flow, moisture from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC unit, let the ice melt, change the filter, and attempt again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, since something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
