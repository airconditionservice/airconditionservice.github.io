<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a requirement for ac system repair, which you must watch out for. First, you need to examine your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little ridiculous, but ice on your ac system can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately if entirely iced over.<p>
