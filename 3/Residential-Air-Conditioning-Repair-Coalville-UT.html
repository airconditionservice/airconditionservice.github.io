<p>A geothermal heating system is more reliable than options, and is not affected by any external aspects, unlike other renewable resources such as wind energy and solar power. For instance, wind energy can just be utilized when there is wind, while solar power depends on regular sunlight to work efficiently. Geothermal heating is dependent on neither the wind nor the sun, but rather takes its heat from the earth's crust, which is constantly hot. This makes geothermal heating a available and trustworthy  source of energy.<p>

<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outside air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the need to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often done in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
