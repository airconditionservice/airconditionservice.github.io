<p>Brian was every bit sincere, enjoyable and responsive. Jeremiah Bartula the plumbing discussed our options prior to our deal with Brian and was incredible, helpful and useful - his work was impeccable! All of his assistants were respectful and diligent. The work website was left utterly cleared and cleaned. We would extremely encourage others to go right to Berkshire Heating and Cooling for all their heating and cooling needs.<p>
<p>Indoor temperatures are sometimes more difficult to manage than they appear due to elements such as heat gains from sunlight, outdoor conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE suggests temperature levels varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer season; indoor relative humidity needs to be kept at or listed below 65%. The EPA suggests humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to reduce mold growth.<p>
<p>Have actually used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. When I have concerns, they offer me priority and a lower rate. Bought a brand-new primary unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never purchase prolonged service warranties or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Excellent investment in my opinion. Never try to sell me something I do not need.<p>
