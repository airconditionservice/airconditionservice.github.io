<h3>Air Conditioning Contractors in Oaks PA</h3>

They are also frequently described as "reverse cycle air conditioner". The heatpump is considerably more energy effective than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, along with the heat from bought electrical energy.
