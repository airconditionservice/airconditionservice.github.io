<p>Cooling can also be offered by a process called free cooling which uses pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is included because the temperature level of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, thereby declining its effectiveness.<p>
