<p>Co2 concentrations increase as an outcome of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the buildup of carbon dioxide to quasi "constant state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based.

Portable instruments used to determine co2 ought to be adjusted frequently, and outside measurements used for estimations need to be made close in time to indoor measurements.
