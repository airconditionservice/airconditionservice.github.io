<p>It is common to assume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, fairly stable in time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the bigger environment).

Buildings can be described and comprehended as complex systems. Research study using the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the constructed environment considering the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
