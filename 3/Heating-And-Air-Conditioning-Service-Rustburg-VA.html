<p>Current Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider because the two professionals I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
