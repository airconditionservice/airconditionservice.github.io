<p>Seattle heaters can run 9 months of the year. Based on the typical temperature levels in our location, if you compared running your furnace to a vehicle it would get the equivalent of 1.8 million miles over its expected life expectancy of 15 years.

<p>A lot of well and city water does not normally contain lead. Water usually gets lead inside the home from home pipes that is made with lead materials.

<p>Air-conditioning systems are always working to give your home that perfect temperature all year round. But while they're cycling through all that air, they're removing a few of those common air contaminants. Ultimately, their air filters fill up and stop doing their task. Not only does that cause problem for your indoor air quality, it likewise uses down your AC system, which can result in expensive repairs down the road. So, be sure to alter your AC filters routinely, or get an a/c service plan which generally consists of a filter change - especially if you are allergy-prone or live in a city with high levels of contamination.<p>
<p>As soon as the furnace senses that the burner has actually reached a high enough temperature, a blower fan will begin to present air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger allows air to be heated up without coming in contact with the real flame or burner area. Once it reaches an enough temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the home's duct work, supplying warm air to individual bed rooms, living spaces and kitchens through the vents or registers.<p>
