<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you may think. Due to the fact that a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive flexible hose pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to wear and tear and is easily pierced.<p>

Likewise, clean ducts and proper airflow are vital to a well-functioning system, however house owners do not have the needed devices for the task. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a savvy house owner, it's still necessary to have a professional technician check the system periodically.<p>
