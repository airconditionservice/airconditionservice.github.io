<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to complete. I 'd priced out brand-new units and installation for months. As soon as I chose to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Ton unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not just was the price great but Mark headed out of his way to personalize a few things in my house to make the total air circulation more enhanced. I believe it literally only took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I believe any future service related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
