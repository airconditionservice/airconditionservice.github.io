<p>A packaged unit, generally installed on the roof, is most frequently used on commercial structures, but it is also an alternative for house owners to consider. Oftentimes, these units consist of not just the air conditioning system itself but likewise a furnace. An advantage of this system is surely the cost. Packaged units are terrific for those aiming to conserve cash on the installation of a new cooling and heating system individually, given that the unit is integrated. However, one con is that these units are generally just readily available for bigger homes due to their high power and capability.

For that reason, this may not be the very best alternative for house owners trying to find short-term savings or those with smaller budgets.<p>
