<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a need for air conditioner repair, which you must watch out for. First, you need to check your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little ridiculous, but ice on your air conditioning system can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
