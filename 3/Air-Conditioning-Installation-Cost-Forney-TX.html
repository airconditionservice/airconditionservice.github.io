EPA's pamphlet, Residential Air-Cleaning Gadgets, provides further information on air-cleaning devices to decrease indoor air toxins.<p>
<p>It may feel comfortable being sealed in tight against the cold in your home throughout the chillier months of the year, however for people who are sensitive to indoor allergens or have breathing issues, winter season can exacerbate problems.

Evaluation of this information may recognize potentially harmful sources of contamination and resultant employee health signs. However, when pollutant concentrations are really low, keeping track of data may not describe the observed or reported health signs.<p>
