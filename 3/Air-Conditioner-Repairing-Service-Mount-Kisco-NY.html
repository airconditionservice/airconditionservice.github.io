<p>Next, and possibly simply as essential when it comes to central air costs, is the AC unit's size. A system that is too big will have a simple time keeping the home cool, but will have a more difficult time removing humidity from the air.

Considering larger systems cost more than smaller systems, it pays to ask a local HVAC expert what size AC system your central air system requires to hold.<p>
