<h3>Things to Consider When Buying a Heat Pump in Stanfield NC</h3>
<p>All contemporary cooling systems, even small window plan systems, are equipped with internal air filters. These are typically of a light-weight gauze-like material, and must be changed or washed as conditions call for. For instance, a structure in a high dust environment, or a house with furry animals, will require to have the filters changed more often than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as required will add to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in squandered energy, shortened equipment life, and higher energy expenses; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air flow. In addition, extremely dirty or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or even fire.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is probably frozen. The cause is typically an absence of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is brought on by a plugged filter. Without airflow, wetness from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC unit, let the ice melt, change the filter, and try once again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, because something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
