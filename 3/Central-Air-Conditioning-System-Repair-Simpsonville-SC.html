<p>Integrity Energy was quick to react when I called Gregg at 9:00 pm when our two furnaces were not working. They appeared the next day and changed 2 heaters and make them work. Bryson and Rob worked from 10:00 am to 8:00 pm on Friday until the new heating systems can heat your house. Truthfully, our house heating unit is made complex, Rob and his group fixed the old duct work, altered all the dampers, make the whole system work completely.<p>

Approximately 40 percent hardly ever or never ever clean their humidifier or kitchen variety hood, though they utilize it daily. One quarter have never cleaned up or changed their furnace filter. And practically 20 percent still smoke at home or let others smoke there. All of those things can worsen indoor air quality.<p>
