Appropriate ventilation and elimination of the sources of these impurities are necessary in maintaining good indoor air quality.<p>
<p>The most typical source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which houses are built.

When radon ends up being trapped in buildings and concentrations develop inside, exposure to radon becomes an issue.<p>
