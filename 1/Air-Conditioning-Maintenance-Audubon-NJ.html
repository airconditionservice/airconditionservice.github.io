<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might believe. Because a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, affordable versatile hose pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to tear and use and is easily punctured.<p>

<p>It may be time to clean up the condensing uni t Filthy condenser coils won't give off heat efficiently and will keep the unit running if the AC doesn't turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay may have bonded together-- something that can occur gradually because of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Before checking the run relay, switch off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, disassemble the relay and pry apart the contacts. This should do the trick until you purchase a replacement-- which you need to do soon.<p>
