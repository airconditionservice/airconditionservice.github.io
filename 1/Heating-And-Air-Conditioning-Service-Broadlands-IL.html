<p>Biological impurities consist of bacteria, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and cat saliva, home allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these contaminants. Pollens stem from plants; viruses are transferred by animals and people; germs are carried by people, animals, and soil and plant particles; and home animals are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a potent allergen. When it dries, it can end up being airborne. Contaminated central air conditioning handling systems can end up being breeding premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological contaminants and can then distribute these impurities through the house.<p>
