<h3>Identifying Shoddy HVAC Ductwork at Pine Lake GA</h3>
<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% examination, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil change' type of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had an extremely small bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'could' trigger a problem in the future. So he said I could swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the exact same cost (it never broke).<p>
