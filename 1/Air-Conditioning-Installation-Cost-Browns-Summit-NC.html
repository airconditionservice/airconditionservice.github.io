<h3>Home Air Conditioning Company in Browns Summit NC</h3>
<p>Some air conditioning systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heatpump, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise typically referred to as "reverse cycle a/c". The heat pump is significantly more energy effective than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, in addition to the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit likewise switches functions to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outside air).<p>
