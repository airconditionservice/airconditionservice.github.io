<h2>How To Hire Residential HVAC Company in Cheyney</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>We are OPEN as an "Essential Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds astounding, but furnace service technicians typically discover that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be switched on. Look for a standard wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Check the breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is safely secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be fully depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding job finding the outdoor unit as near to your house as possible per my request. The job took 2 days and my yard and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely educated of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained up until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
