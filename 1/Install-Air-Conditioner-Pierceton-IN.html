<p>For a heated flooring location less than 20 sq. ft., you might (for the most part) draw power from a nearby GFCI-protected outlet without overwhelming the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is already GFCI safeguarded like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad must be GFCI safeguarded.) However a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can trigger overloads and nuisance breaker journeys. For our larger mat, we chose to set up a dedicated circuit with its own wiring and breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are offered.<p>

<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your car's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by flowing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant flows. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator fails, the excess heat produced by the engine might damage the engine parts. To avoid this from taking place, have your radiator serviced regularly. To have your radiator needs handled by specialists, visit Acme Auto Electric & Repair today.<p>
