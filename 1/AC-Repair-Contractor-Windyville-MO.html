Buildings can be described and understood as complex systems. Research applying the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can assist increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
