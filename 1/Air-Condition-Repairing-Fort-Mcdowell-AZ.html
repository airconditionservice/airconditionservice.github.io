<h3>Solar Heating System in Fort Mcdowell AZ</h3>
<p>I usually don't leave evaluations however wished to share my experience. You don't expect having to replace your AC system. Unfortunately for us, we had no other alternative. What made me choose this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my options. After organisation hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and discuss alternatives. I arranged my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a household pal and now I will suggest this company to my good friends.<p>
<p>G&S did an outstanding job installing our brand-new furnace and AC system. The best aspect of G&S is that they guarantee for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace failed within a couple of months (no fault of G&S). Manufacturers guarantee would cover the parts cost but G&S repaired and covered labor cost under their warranty. Likewise they identified the problem and fixed extremely quickly. Certainly A++ installation and service.<p>
<p>Next, and perhaps just as important when it comes to central air conditioning costs, is the AC unit's size. An unit that is too large will have an easy time keeping the house cool, however will have a more difficult time removing humidity from the air. On the other hand, a system that is too small will not have the ability to appropriately cool the house on hot days. Considering bigger units cost more than smaller sized units, it pays to ask a local HVAC professional what size AC unit your central air system requires to hold.<p>
<p>It is common to assume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, relatively steady in time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a building as fairly unchanged physical material with time. In truth, the real nature of buildings can be considered as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be explained and comprehended as complex systems. Research using the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of communities can assist increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the constructed environment considering the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
