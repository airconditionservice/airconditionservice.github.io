<p>We tend to think of air pollution as something outside - ozone, haze, or smog hanging in the air, particularly in summer. Connection concerns along the line that provides power to your furnace can compromise the performance of the system. Loose, missing or defective wires will cause the thermostat to lose its connection to the unit and interrupt service. Part of keeping your furnace includes checking the advised connections as well as temperature and pressure assesses. Take some time to check these parts for dust and damage, making certain that they are safe and secure and tight.<p>
<p>More common in fairly older houses, a boiler-based heating system utilizes gas, electricity or oil to heat water and produce steam that moves through pipes to heat radiators in individual rooms. All-electric boilers can achieve up to 95 to one hundred percent AFUE, according to the DOE. Newer gas boilers must attain 80 percent AFUE and newer fossil-fueled boilers need to attain a 75 percent AFUE.<p>
