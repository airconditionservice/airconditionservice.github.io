<p>Cooling can likewise be provided by a procedure called free cooling which uses pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heatpump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added because the temperature level of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, thus decreasing its efficiency.<p>
<p>The cost for heat pump installation also depends upon the size of the unit and whether it is a single-room or whole-home system. A single-room air-to-air system can cost as low as $500, including installation. Whole-house units, on the other hand, range in cost from $2,500 to $7,500, including installation. Geothermal heat pumps usually require excavation to install, which includes a number of thousand dollars to the cost.<p>

There is currently no evidence, nevertheless, that an affordable number of houseplants get rid of substantial quantities of toxins in houses and offices. Indoor houseplants must not be over-watered due to the fact that excessively damp soil may promote the growth of microorganisms which can affect allergic individuals.<p>
