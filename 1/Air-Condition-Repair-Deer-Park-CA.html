The job took 2 days and my backyard and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was very well-informed of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
