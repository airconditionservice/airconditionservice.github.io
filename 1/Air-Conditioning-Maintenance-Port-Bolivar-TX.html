<h3>Electric Heating System in Port Bolivar TX</h3>
<p>It is still possible that an indoor air contamination issue exists if no pollutant sources are discovered. Extreme re-circulation of air leads to "stagnant air" conditions. Stale air has higher levels of co2 and carbon monoxide (produced from human breathing and cigarette smoke, respectively) than outdoors air.

<p>Fantastic Item! Shipment was sort of odd being that package was opened and products could have fell out. But after evaluation of contents we guaranteed it was all intact. The product was extremely lite weight and takes some time to use. Note: purchase suggested non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We utilized the Kerdi as advised to the height of the shower head and had to adjust the shower flooring and curb to fit. Be sure to view the video initially prior to installation and follow all instructions exactly. If you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had concerns with air bubble pockets. After contacting assistance, we dealt with problems. I would recommend this item to anybody who's renovating or installing their restroom for the first time.
