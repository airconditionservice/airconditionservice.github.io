<p>Ron, the owner, connected to me regarding an uncommonly high expense that I got blindsided by BEFORE he knew that I had called the service manager and left a message of issue. Ron had found the trouble area in looking over the bill. He solved the problem in one day, had adjusted the bill to what I thought about reasonable prior to he called back, knew what might have triggered the problem and had a plan to insure that it would not occur again. I have considered All Points a company with stability for the nine years we have actually used them. This experience validates that.<p>
<p>My eldest boy constantly grumbled about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a brand-new one. For a long time I dismissed him but then I recognized that it really didnâ $ t distribute air like it did in the past. Weâ $ ve had the important things for 16 years so I didnâ $ t actually think of anything else other than replacing it. The one I got is worth every cent. The noise level is itâ and low $ s fantastic on energy saving too.<p>
