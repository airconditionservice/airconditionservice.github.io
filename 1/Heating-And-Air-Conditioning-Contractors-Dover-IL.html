<p>If you think a mold problem-- either due to the fact that of visible growth or a musty odor regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much excellent if it doesn't eliminate the mold. Mold begins with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source.

When the a/c works but your house does not cool, the problem is most likely in the distribution system.<p>
