<p>Wow - simply wow. I never have actually heard of the $5000 rule however got ta provide whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one indoors and never ever needs maintenance and one outdoors and needs yearly and even bi-annual maintenance.

After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to purchase stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up rather than buy something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are simply crazy and all over the place and I think they know they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
