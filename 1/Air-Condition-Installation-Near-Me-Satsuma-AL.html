<p>Excellent Item! Delivery was kind of unusual being that the box was opened and products could have fell out. But after review of contents we ensured it was all intact. The item was exceptionally lite weight and takes some time to use. Keep in mind: purchase recommended non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and had to change the shower flooring and curb to fit. Be sure to see the video first prior to installation and follow all directions precisely. If you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had problems with air bubble pockets. After getting in touch with support, we dealt with issues. I would suggest this item to anyone who's redesigning or installing their restroom for the first time.
