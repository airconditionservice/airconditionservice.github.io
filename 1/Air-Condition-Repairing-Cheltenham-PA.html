<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't lucrative you would not offer them.. Second of all like extended automobile service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is actually sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the required skills to do the job and likewise the morals to treat consumers relatively. As a client you require to be well notified in order not to be totally made the most of. Most companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to sell new versus repair. Finally found somebody to properly service and the unit has been running issue free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>

<p>IÃ¢ $ m truly fussy with my things. I like my equipment and devices original, I wonÃ¢ $ t have anything to do with cheap knock-offs.
