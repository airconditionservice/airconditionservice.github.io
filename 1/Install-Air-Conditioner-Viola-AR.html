<p>Co2 (CO2) is a relatively easy to measure surrogate for indoor toxins released by human beings, and correlates with human metabolic activity. Co2 at levels that are uncommonly high inside your home may cause residents to grow sleepy, to get headaches, or to work at lower activity levels. Outdoor CO2 levels are generally 350-450 ppm whereas the maximum indoor CO2 level thought about acceptable is 1000 ppm. 28 Human beings are the primary indoor source of carbon dioxide in the majority of structures. Indoor CO2 levels are a sign of the adequacy of outside air ventilation relative to indoor occupant density and metabolic activity.<p>
<p>When all the jobs have actually been completed, the last job is to evaluate the system to make sure it cools efficiently. HVAC systems are run through the thermostat.

At the conclusion of the service check, your HVAC technician talks about any problems or issues and makes recommendations about upgrades where suitable.<p>
