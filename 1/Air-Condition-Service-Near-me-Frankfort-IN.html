<p>Unpredictable natural substances (VOCs)-- These are the primary factors to bad indoor air quality; they are common both inside your home and outdoors. VOCs are natural chemicals emitted as gases from products or processes; for the many part, you can smell their existence.

(Even something as apparently harmless as a brand-new carpet is likely to be giving off formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outside could include volatile chemicals in contaminated groundwater that are pulled within throughout water use.<p>
<p>Almost half of Americans use air fresheners a minimum of once a week, and 34 percent usage candle lights or incense that regularly, our nationally representative study found. Roughly 40 percent rarely or never clean their humidifier or kitchen area variety hood, though they utilize it daily. One quarter have actually never ever cleaned or changed their furnace filter. And nearly 20 percent still smoke at home or let others smoke there. All of those things can intensify indoor air quality.<p>
