<p>Cooling can also be supplied by a procedure called complimentary cooling which utilizes pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heatpump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heat pump is included due to the fact that the temperature level of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, therefore declining its efficiency.<p>
