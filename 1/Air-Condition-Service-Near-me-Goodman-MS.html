<h3>Heating And Cooling Repair in Goodman MS</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you may believe. Since many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a little, economical flexible tube) instead of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to tear and wear and is quickly pierced.<p>
