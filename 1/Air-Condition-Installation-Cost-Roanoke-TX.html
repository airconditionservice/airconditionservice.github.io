<p>We're spending a lot more time inside, nowadays. While many people presume contamination is just an outdoor issue, your house (and office) can also be contaminated. As a society, we make certain that our homes are well-insulated and well-sealed, but we don't believe sufficient about direct exposure to all the things we place in our homes," states Susan Olesik, PhD, Professor of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio. The air quality within and around structures and buildings has a huge impact on your health, and while you can feel the signs-- shortness of breath, dizziness, queasiness-- right away, they can come on years after direct exposure, according to the federal Epa (EPA). Here's how to breathe easier.<p>
<p>Before you start installing the actual duct work, it is very important to plan out your duct setup in order to ensure that there suffices space in the ceilings, walls, and floors to run your duct and that there suffices space in each space of your house to connect the heating system. After you have actually drawn up the whole network of duct work, install the ducts piece by piece, ensuring that they reach every space where you want heat distributed.<p>
