<h3>Ductwork Cleaning in Strasburg CO</h3>
<p>Wow - just wow. I never have actually heard of the $5000 guideline but got ta provide whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heating systems - one inside and never ever requires maintenance and one outdoors and requires yearly or even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to purchase stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of buy something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just insane and all over the location and I think they know they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
