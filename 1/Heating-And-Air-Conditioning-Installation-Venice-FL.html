<p>Indoor temperatures are in some cases more challenging to manage than they seem due to elements such as heat gains from sunlight, outdoor conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE recommends temperature levels varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer; indoor relative humidity should be preserved at or below 65%. The EPA advises humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to lower mold growth.<p>
<p>Indoor contamination sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the main reason for indoor air quality issues. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor toxin levels by not generating adequate outdoor air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air contaminants out of the area. High temperature and humidity levels can likewise increase concentrations of some toxins.<p>
