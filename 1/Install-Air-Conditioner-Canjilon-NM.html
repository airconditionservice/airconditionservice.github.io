<p>Weatherization typically does not trigger indoor air problems by adding brand-new contaminants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes release pollutants.)

Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the house can increase.<p>

Glycol piping and external heat exchangers ought to be insulated with fiberglass pipe insulation. Duct tape can be utilized on the joints of the water piping insulation, and use the joint tape that includes fiberglass piping insulation. Insulation exposed to sunshine can be secured by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation used outside need to be protected with PVC insulation covers.<p>
