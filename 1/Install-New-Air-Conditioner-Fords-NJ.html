During the summertime and winter, central air conditioning systems and heaters offer sufficient cooling and heating power to houses in Redmond. The typical daytime temperature highs vary from the low to upper-70s during June, July, and August, and when heat waves travel through the neighborhood, temperatures will rise to the mid-80s. When effectively set up and well maintained, central air conditioning units keep homeowners of Redmond comfy and cool inside.<p>
<p>The majority of central air conditioners are linked to a home's forced-air distribution system. Hence, the exact same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are utilized to distribute cool air from the air conditioning system.

The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool the house. When the ac system works however the house does not cool, the problem is most likely in the distribution system.<p>
