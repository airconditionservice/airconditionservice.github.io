<p>Heating is the largest energy expense in the typical home. In very dry climates, evaporative coolers, in some cases described as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a damp pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water.

The temperature level of the inbound air is decreased, but it is likewise more humid, so the total heat (sensible heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. A few of the reasonable heat of the entering air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the going into air is dry enough, the outcomes can be quite substantial.<p>
