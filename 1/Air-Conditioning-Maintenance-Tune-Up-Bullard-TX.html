<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odorless gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the nose, eye, and throat and triggers shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the danger of breathing infection; there is likewise proof from animal research studies that duplicated direct exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the advancement of lung illness such as emphysema. People at specific risk from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide include kids and people with asthma and other respiratory illness.<p>
<p>People working in structures with bad IAQ might see musty or undesirable odors or may feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some employees grumble about signs that take place at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more severe problem. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been linked to IAQ problems. Talk to your doctor about them if you have signs that are not going away or are getting worse. But not all direct exposures trigger symptoms, so there is no replacement for excellent structure management.<p>
<p>Indoor contamination sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the main cause of indoor air quality problems. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor pollutant levels by not generating enough outdoor air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air toxins out of the area. High temperature and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some toxins.<p>
