<p>To say there are a lot of variables in setting up solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the ac system back into its initial box, using the dense-foam packing material to safeguard it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware items in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in package. Set the box in a cool, dry place for the winter. And if the storage room has a concrete floor, location two 2x4s below the box to raise it up and secure it from wetness.<p>

<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier since the two technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Sean was extremely useful. He is an extremely enjoyable individual to work with. No pressure applied to buy extra stuff. Addressed all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He was able to put rise protectors on the unit and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to ensure they were no concerns aside from the blower motor. Because there was not one on hand, the only reason he might not install the brand-new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he understands for sure what the concern is.<p>
