<p>Because an air conditioner moves heat between the outside coil and the indoor coil, both should be kept tidy. This means that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also required to regularly clean up the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will ultimately result in damage to the compressor, due to the fact that the condenser coil is responsible for releasing both the indoor heat (as gotten by the evaporator) and the heat produced by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might believe. Due to the fact that most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive versatile tube) instead of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to tear and use and is quickly punctured.<p>
<p>Oil heating systems are normally not very efficient. They use less fuel than other furnace types, but the majority of do not attain a performance greater than 90%. A couple of high-end brands have a performance of 95% by utilizing a condenser. These are more pricey, having starting expenses for the furnace itself at around $5,000. You pay more for the installation too since a drain needs to be set up.<p>
