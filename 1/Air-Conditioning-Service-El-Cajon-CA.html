<h3>Ductless AC System in El Cajon CA</h3>
<p>Some a/c systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also frequently described as "reverse cycle a/c". The heat pump is considerably more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, in addition to the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system also switches functions to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
