<p>If you presume a mold problem-- either since of visible development or a musty smell consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much excellent if it does not eliminate the mold. Mold starts with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can check and maintain.
