<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a need for air conditioning unit repair, which you should look out for. First, you should examine your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little absurd, however ice on your a/c can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately if completely iced over.<p>
