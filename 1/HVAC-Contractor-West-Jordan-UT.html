<p>Called WSE for a routine inspection. The tech appeared right on time and was friendly & educated throughout the go to. They recommended changing a few parts that were heading out. They weren't low-cost but a fast internet search verified WSE wasn't inflating prices, so I happily had them changed. However, a week later on the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in exact same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they installed the week prior was faulty. No charge for the visit or the brand-new part. I was very happy they stood by their work and repaired the problem. Will definitely be utilizing them again.<p>
<p>Energy effectiveness can be improved a lot more in central heating systems by presenting zoned heating. This allows a more granular application of heat, similar to non-central heater.
