<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to give your house that ideal temperature all year round. However while they're cycling through all that air, they're filtering out a few of those typical air pollutants. Eventually, their air filters fill and stop doing their task. Not only does that cause difficulty for your indoor air quality, it also wears down your AC system, which can cause costly repairs down the roadway. So, be sure to alter your AC filters routinely, or get a cooling service plan which normally includes a filter modification - especially if you are allergy-prone or reside in a city with high levels of pollution.<p>
