<p>Free cooling systems can have really high efficiencies, and are often integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be utilized for summertime a/c. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heatpump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added-in since the storage functions as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to slowly increase during the cooling season.<p>

<p>I have been utilizing them for many years for my organisations, my own homes and my property clients' houses. I went through five other companies prior to I discovered Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All five other companies estimated me with different prices and various problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th person, who described to me thoroughly the issues which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC stopped working at my rental house. When I called and he recommended me to get in touch with warranty which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the unit working again, he assisted me problem shoot the concern. He is truthful, reliable, and reasonable on cost. It's hard to find a truthful AC person and I'm happy I discovered Luis. Highly suggest Luis and his company.<p>
