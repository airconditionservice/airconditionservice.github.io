<p>Indoor Air Quality Guide: Best Practices for Design, Building And Construction and Commissioning is created for architects, design engineers, contractors, commissioning agents, and all other specialists worried about indoor air quality. Our specialists explain all of your alternatives before beginning the repair, so you can decide whether a repair or replacement is best for you. Our No Surprises Rates-- including charging by the task, not by the hour-- suggests the rate we estimate you is the rate you pay. If you decide that replacing your furnace is the best strategy, we can install a new, high-efficiency model in its place.<p>
<p>A ducted heatpump looks like a big central air conditioner system that sits outside your house. Heat pumps work on electrical power and work like air conditioners in reverse, using a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outside air. This permits them to produce 2 to 3 times as much heat as a standard electric heating system (like a space heating system) with the very same quantity of electrical power. They can be linked to your existing ductwork, if you are changing a gas or oil furnace.<p>

<p>Lots of people underestimate the level of the indoor air pollution problem. Air pollution is normally pictured as the black smoke released from factories. Little thought is offered to tobacco smoke and the spin-offs of aerosol sprays, paints, cleaners, and pesticides used in the house. To compound the issue, it is estimated that the typical American spends 70 percent to 90 percent of his/her time inside your home, and majority that time is invested in the home.<p>
<p>Benzene is a known human carcinogen. The main indoor sources of this chemical are ecological tobacco smoke, kept fuels and paint products, and automobile emissions in connected garages. Actions that will minimize benzene exposure consist of removing cigarette smoking within the house, providing for optimum ventilation during painting, and disposing of paint supplies and unique fuels that will not be utilized instantly.<p>
