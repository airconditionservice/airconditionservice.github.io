<p>When they position a 24 hour emergency ac repair demand, the majority of Midtown Houston Tx consumers do not know why their HVAC system is not working. If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outdoors unit we'll be frozen too. Depending upon how thick the ice build-up is at your condensing unit, then you'll have a good concept of how thick the ice accumulation remains in the evaporator coil. The first thing you need to do is to check your conditioning filters. If your filter is dirty, you're in luck, that's most likely your issue. The next action is to defrost your air conditioning equipment if you discovered that your conditioning filter needs replacing. The simplest method to defrost your HVAC equipment is to leave the unit off for a few hours, with the blower fan running.<p>
