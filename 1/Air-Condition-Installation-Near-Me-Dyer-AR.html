<p>Your lungs are responsible for bringing fresh air into your body, while all at once removing waste gases and particulates.

<p>Because an air conditioning system moves heat in between the indoor coil and the outside coil, both need to be kept clean. This suggests that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also essential to frequently clean up the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will ultimately lead to damage to the compressor, due to the fact that the condenser coil is accountable for discharging both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat produced by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
