<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Discovered both inside and outside, particulate matter is a mix of liquid beads and strong particles suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, soot, and pollen. The particles themselves are various sizes, but the ones to be most concerned about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller-- due to the fact that they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outside PM, produced by building, for example, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, enters into structures through mechanical and natural ventilation. Inside your home it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Keep an eye out for signs of water leaks or flooding to stop mold from growing. Porous materials, floor, wall, and ceiling coverings, and furnishings found in the basements that have been wet for over 24 to 2 days might become a source for mold growth and should be disposed of. Often there is a musty odor but mold can not be seen. Mold does not need light to grow and can flourish in surprise or hardly ever accessed areas of your house, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a variety of surfaces: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on flooring products including carpet underpadding. If a source of water or condensation can be discovered, chances are there will be mold growing nearby. Fix the moisture problem, either by locating the leakage or water source or by dehumidifying the area. Thoroughly clean the location using recognized health department suggestions.<p>
