<p>My home has 5 systems, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" found something wrong with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned up for an extra $30.00.
