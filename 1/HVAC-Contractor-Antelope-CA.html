<p>In a normal residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar made to his workers, devices expenses, marketing, utilities, and other expenditures prior to paying himself anything. Generally this leaves about 6% of earnings to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This doesn't seem like much, especially if the objective of owning an organisation was for financial flexibility. Plus, this 6% is after the couple of years it took to construct the business and not taking an income as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% normally isn't completion goal.
