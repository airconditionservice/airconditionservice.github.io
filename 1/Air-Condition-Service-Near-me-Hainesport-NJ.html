<p>We tend to think about air pollution as something outdoors - haze, smog, or ozone hanging in the air, specifically in summer. These convection heating systems are still commonly utilized and are usually called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is generally oil or natural gas, but some are electrically powered also.<p>
