<p>Proper ventilation helps improve indoor air quality. It's simple to think that the air quality outside is even worse than the air quality inside. We know about air contamination and acid rain, we can see smoke and smell exhaust, and we might even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck spew thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air toxins are frequently 2 to 5 times higher than outdoor levels, and in some cases these levels can surpass 100 times that of outdoor levels of the very same contaminants. Simply put, often the air inside can be more damaging than the air exterior.<p>
<p>If you seem like the air produced by your heat pump is burning out cold, you may not have a problem as long as your house still heats to the best temperature level.

Only be concerned if your house is not heating up. Nevertheless, if your system does not seem working correctly, check outside to see if your system is frozen or covered in ice. This would be a circumstances where you must contact an expert to repair the system and check.<p>
