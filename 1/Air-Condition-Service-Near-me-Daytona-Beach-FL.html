<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier because the two specialists I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, relatively steady in time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a building as reasonably unchanged physical product with time. In reality, the real nature of structures can be deemed the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be explained and understood as intricate systems. Research study using the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can assist increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the constructed environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
