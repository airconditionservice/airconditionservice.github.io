<p>How environment modification affects air quality and exposure to air toxins. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature level (which is a basic mode of operation for modern a/c unit) needs that the rate of energy removal by the a/c boost. This boost has the result that, for each unit of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioning system eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioner should increase its power usage by the inverse of its "efficiency" (coefficient of performance) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is activated, and the ac system has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioning unit's power usage will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, thus making the 100 W heating component cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>

<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider because the two specialists I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
