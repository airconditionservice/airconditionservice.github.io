<p>Heating is the largest energy expense in the average house.

The sensible heat of the inbound air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is lowered. The temperature level of the incoming air is minimized, but it is likewise more damp, so the total heat (reasonable heat plus latent heat) is unchanged.
