Reedy chooses the owners stay on and reinvest a part of their equity from the sale back into the company, although this isn't a requirement.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to complete. I 'd priced out brand-new units and installation for months. Once I chose to final progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Lot system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not only was the rate great however Mark headed out of his way to personalize a couple of things in my house to make the general air circulation more optimized. I think it actually just took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future business associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
