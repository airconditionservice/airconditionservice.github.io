<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider since the two professionals I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts.

The technician spent a good quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
