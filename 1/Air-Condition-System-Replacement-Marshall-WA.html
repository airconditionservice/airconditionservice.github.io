<p>SysTech Design concentrates on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for improving and keeping the quality of the air around an industrial environment.

Condensed moisture can trigger dust and other particles to adhere to and build up on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils guarantees dirt does not develop and get drawn into the system. It likewise avoids water from building up on and underneath the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>
