<p>You are a covidiot if you need furnace work in West Seattle and do not user James Heating. Our furnace went down with a damaged igniter, and no one else might come other than for SW. They came and stated it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the task, but they had to buy it. My partner said that she had actually seen a fantastic evaluation for James, so I called. He was available in a few hours (weaving a mask) and described the scenario to me. He stated it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 total. He offered to come back today, but I moved it to tomorrow. James is one of the nicest, most good people I have met in a very long time. If we want to have alternatives to ACME heating, we need to support the real individuals who are there for us.
