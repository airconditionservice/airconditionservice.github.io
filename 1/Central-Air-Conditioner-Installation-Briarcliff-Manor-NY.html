<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Simply this morning I saw I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the very same day. He understood simply what the issue was and fixed it extremely rapidly. But here is the BEST ONE. About ten years ago my entire cooling and gas heat went absolutely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan was able to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he could have charged me for a lot more.<p>
