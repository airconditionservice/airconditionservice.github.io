<p>I am very satisfied with this company. One of my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) identified the problem within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call business many years earlier and understand the value of having the right parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also impressed that he appeared at my home at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will certainly be using Waycoff's again, and would recommend them to everybody. Thank You quite.<p>
<p>Keep an eye out for signs of water leakages or flooding to stop mold from growing. Porous materials, ceiling, flooring, and wall coverings, and furnishings discovered in the basements that have been damp for over 24 to two days may end up being a source for mold development and must be disposed of. Sometimes there is a musty smell but mold can not be seen. Mold does not need light to grow and can grow in concealed or rarely accessed areas of your home, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a variety of surfaces: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on floor covering materials consisting of carpet underpadding. If a source of water or condensation can be found, chances are there will be mold growing nearby. Fix the moisture issue, either by finding the leakage or water source or by dehumidifying the location. Completely tidy the area using established health department suggestions.<p>
