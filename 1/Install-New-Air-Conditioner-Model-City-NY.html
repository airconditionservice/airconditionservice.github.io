<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a relatively simple to measure surrogate for indoor pollutants emitted by human beings, and associates with human metabolic activity. Carbon dioxide at levels that are abnormally high inside may cause residents to grow sleepy, to get headaches, or to operate at lower activity levels. Outside CO2 levels are usually 350-450 ppm whereas the maximum indoor CO2 level considered appropriate is 1000 ppm. 28 Humans are the primary indoor source of co2 in many structures. Indoor CO2 levels are a sign of the adequacy of outside air ventilation relative to indoor resident density and metabolic activity.<p>
<p>Check these three things initially if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make certain all the registers in your home are broad open. Then make certain the furnace filter is tidy Then go tidy and outdoors off the condenser coils (Image 2). If numerous registers were closed or the filter was blocked, the lowered air flow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. Deice the A-coil if you have actually altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or till there's good airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to check it. You've fixed the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
