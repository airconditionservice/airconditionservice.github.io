Just like other kinds of heat pumps, ground source heatpump have their geothermal effectiveness rated according to their coefficient of performance (POLICE OFFICER). POLICE rates just how much heat a system removes or produces (depending upon whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus just how much the system uses to produce the heating or cooling result. Most ground source heatpump have Polices of about 3.0 to 5.0.
