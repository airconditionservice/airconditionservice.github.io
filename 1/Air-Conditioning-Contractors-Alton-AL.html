<p>Routine maintenance keeps a furnace working effectively, according to HVAC professionals like Dave Mejean of B&W Plumbing & Heating in Indianapolis.

Start to compare the cost of your recent heating bills with heating costs from the previous years. If there is a considerable distinction, then it's time to replace your furnace.<p>
