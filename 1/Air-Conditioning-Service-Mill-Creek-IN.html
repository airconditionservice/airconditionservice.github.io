Their techs are extremely knowledgeable and professional. Expenses are affordable. Always on time, and call when they are on their method. Waychoff set up a new air handler and condenser this week. I did not bother to get competitor's quotes due to the fact that of my trust in Waychoff because the cost was obviously affordable.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance contract is not worth the paper it is written on. Every technician will inform you clean the filters, take a hose twice a year and clear out the compressor cabinet. Do not obstruct the vents. Vacuum the signs up at least one a year. Vacuum the consumption vent in your home. Now the "hard part" once a year shut down the electrical energy open the furnace and extremely carefully vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, do not touch the parts, close up the cabinet returned on the electricity. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
