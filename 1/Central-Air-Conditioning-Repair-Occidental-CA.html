<p>You might update to the highest effectiveness equipment offered and still not feel conveniently cool on hot days.

Prior to deciding whether to repair or change your condenser and blower units, your technician needs to run a duct-leakage test, by sealing the vents and measuring how much air gets away the system.<p>
