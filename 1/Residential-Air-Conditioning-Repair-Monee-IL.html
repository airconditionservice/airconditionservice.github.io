<p>We are OPEN as an "Vital Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. The quality of air in residential structures has actually become an important issue to homeowners and health professionals. Indoor air pollution research studies have identified numerous impurities that can be present in indoor air. These consist of combustion products, volatile organic compounds (including formaldehyde), tobacco smoke, bioaerosols, and pesticides. Appropriate ventilation and removal of the sources of these impurities are necessary in keeping excellent indoor air quality.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts include the development and application of multizone air flow and indoor air quality designs, particularly the CONTAM series which anticipates airflows and contaminant concentrations in multizone building systems. CONTAM is based upon a graphic user interface that allows the user to draw floor plans on a "sketchpad" and employ "icons" to represent airflow courses, ventilation system parts, and impurity sources. CONTAM has actually been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transportation in large residential, workplace, and school buildings.<p>

<p>Self-installation tends to create more problems than it fixes. In truth, it typically triggers expert intervention anyway to fix some of the concerns that were developed during the installation.

<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high effectiveness, and are often integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summer season air conditioning. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heatpump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in since the storage functions as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (rather than charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
