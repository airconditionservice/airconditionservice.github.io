The reasonable heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature level of the inbound air is reduced, but it is also more humid, so the overall heat (sensible heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. Some of the practical heat of the entering air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. If the entering air is dry enough, the outcomes can be rather significant.<p>
