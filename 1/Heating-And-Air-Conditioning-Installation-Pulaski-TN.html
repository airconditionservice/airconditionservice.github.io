Today's furnaces are rated 90% effectiveness or better; it is not uncommon for a modern-day furnace to be rated 94 or 95% efficient. Compared to older designs, which may be rated as low as 80% performance, this can imply significant savings in yearly heating expenses. Modern 2- and three-stage heaters increase efficiency even further by running at lower or higher capacity depending on the heating requirements of the area.<p>
<p>There are numerous things to take into account when trying to find out how frequently I must replace my air conditioning filters. Every Houston Heights 77007 77008 home has an unique DNA on how it accumulates dust and dirt.

After that, you can make a better best decision on how often your HVAC filters require replacing. Some Houston Midtown 77003 77004 homes have more than one HVAC filter, like townhouses. The more air filters you have in your Houston Galleria 77055 77056 77057 home, the less often you'll have to clean them. Houston Montrose 77006 77098 homes with only one a/c filter require replacing more often.<p>
