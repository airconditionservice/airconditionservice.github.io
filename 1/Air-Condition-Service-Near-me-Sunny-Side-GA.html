<p>A packaged unit, normally set up on the roofing system, is most commonly used on commercial structures, but it is also a choice for homeowners to think about. Often times, these units include not only the air conditioning unit itself but also a furnace. A benefit of this system is certainly the cost. Packaged systems are great for those seeking to save money on the installation of a new heating & cooling system individually, given that the unit is integrated. However, one con is that these units are typically only offered for larger homes due to their high power and capability. Additionally, while they can be an excellent way to save cash on a total HVAC system, they're still substantially more expensive than purchasing simply a cooling system. For that reason, this may not be the best choice for house owners trying to find short-term savings or those with smaller budget plans.<p>
