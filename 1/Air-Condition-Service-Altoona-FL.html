However, for the majority of the United States and many parts of Europe and Japan, during most of hours of the year, outside air temperature levels are cool enough that the air does not need further cooling to supply thermal convenience inside.

Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heatpump to chill the circulation originating from the storage.
