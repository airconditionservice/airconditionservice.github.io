<h3>What to Think about when Buying a Heat Pump in Nutley NJ</h3>
<p>We found Jake and Adam to be wonderful, and were extremely happy that someone as knowledgeable as Adam had the ability to fix the air and return conditioner. We had actually bought the club member maintenance plan, which helped offset the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our tip to any homebuyers: work with Blue Flame to check the a/c unit prior to you purchase. We bought this home in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, but Adam stated he had ways to test AC units even in winter season. We wish we had known him then.<p>
