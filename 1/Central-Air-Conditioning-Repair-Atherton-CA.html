<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't successful you would not use them.  Secondly like prolonged vehicle warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is really sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the needed skills to do the job and likewise the morals to deal with customers relatively. As a customer you need to be well notified in order not to be totally taken advantage of. Most companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to properly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to offer new versus repair. Finally discovered somebody to appropriately service and the system has been operating issue free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>

<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as an outcome of human tenancy, however lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the buildup of co2 to quasi "steady state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based.
