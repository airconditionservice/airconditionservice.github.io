<h3>HVAC Furnace Air Filters - Things You Have to Know Before Buying in Willisburg KY</h3>
<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is connected to a remote condenser unit utilizing refrigerant piping between a outdoor and indoor unit rather of ducting air straight from the outside unit. Indoor systems with directional vents mount onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or suit the ceiling. Other indoor systems mount inside the ceiling cavity, so that short lengths of duct manage air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the spaces.<p>
<p>Because an air conditioning system moves heat between the indoor coil and the outdoor coil, both need to be kept tidy. This implies that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also needed to regularly clean up the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser tidy will eventually lead to harm to the compressor, because the condenser coil is responsible for discharging both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat produced by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
