<p>It is common to assume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable with time. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what remains in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the frustrating bulk of the mass of product in a structure as fairly unchanged physical product in time.

Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment thinking about the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
