<p>There are some varieties of mold which contain harmful compounds (mycotoxins). However, direct exposure to hazardous levels of mycotoxin by means of inhalation is not possible for the most part, as toxic substances are produced by the fungal body and are not at substantial levels in the launched spores.

More severe than many allergenic properties is the capability of mold to trigger episodes face to faces that already have asthma, a severe respiratory disease.<p>
<p>Some health effects can be helpful indicators of an indoor air quality issue, especially if they appear after a person relocates to a new home, remodels or refurnishes a house, or deals with a house with pesticides.

Briefly increasing ventilation coupled with proper usage of the exhaust system while painting or applying pesticides, for instance, can be useful in watering down the concentration of poisonous fumes in the air.<p>
