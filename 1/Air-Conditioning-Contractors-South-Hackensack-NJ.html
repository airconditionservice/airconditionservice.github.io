In really dry environments, evaporative coolers, often referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during heat.

The sensible heat of the incoming air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature level of the inbound air is decreased, however it is also more damp, so the total heat (practical heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. A few of the reasonable heat of the going into air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The results can be rather substantial if the getting in air is dry enough.<p>
