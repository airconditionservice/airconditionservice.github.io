These calculations take into account things such as the size of your home, its direct exposure to the sun and wind, the number and size of windows, how well insulated it is and more. This step is important so the system isn't too small or too large-both waste energy.<p>
<p>It is particularly important to take as many of these steps as possible while you are associated with short-term activities that can produce high levels of pollutants-for example, painting, paint removing, heating with kerosene heating units, cooking, or taking part in maintenance and pastime activities such as welding, soldering, or sanding.
