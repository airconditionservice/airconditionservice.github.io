<p>It might feel comfortable being sealed in tight against the cold in your house throughout the chillier months of the year, but for individuals who are sensitive to indoor irritants or have breathing problems, winter season can exacerbate issues. Stale indoor air and heating unit can increase the amount of allergy-inducing allergen, pet dander, and mold spores distributing through your house. In late winter and early spring, it may still be too chilly to throw open the windows to take out the musty air, so while you await the warmer weather it is necessary to be aware of a few of the allergy and respiratory triggers that may be prowling in your environments.<p>
<p>Indoor temperature levels are often more difficult to control than they seem due to aspects such as heat gains from sunshine, outside conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE advises temperature levels varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summertime; indoor relative humidity needs to be kept at or below 65%.
