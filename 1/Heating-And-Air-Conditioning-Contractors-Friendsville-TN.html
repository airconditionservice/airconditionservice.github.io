<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't lucrative you wouldn't provide them.. Second of all like prolonged automobile guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is actually unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the needed abilities to do the job and also the morals to deal with customers fairly. As a customer you need to be well informed in order not to be completely taken advantage of. The majority of companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to correctly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to offer new versus repair. Lastly discovered someone to properly service and the unit has actually been running issue free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
