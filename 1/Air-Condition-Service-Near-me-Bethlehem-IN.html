<p>If you suspect a mold issue-- either since of noticeable growth or a moldy smell consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much great if it does not eliminate the mold. Mold starts with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can check and keep. Leaky return ducts can also introduce wetness. Once again, if you presume a mold problem, think about having a service company inspect the duct system for leakages.<p>
<p>If you have a large house, a house with high ceilings, a home with lots of windows or a home with inadequate insulation, heating your floors rather than the air might not suffice to reach the level of convenience to which you are accustomed.
