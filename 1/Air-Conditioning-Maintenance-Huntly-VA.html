<p>Indoor temperature levels are in some cases more tough to control than they appear due to aspects such as heat gains from sunlight, outdoor conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE recommends temperature levels varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summertime; indoor relative humidity must be kept at or below 65%. The EPA suggests humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to lower mold growth.<p>

High temperature and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some pollutants.<p>
