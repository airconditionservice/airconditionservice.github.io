Apotheosis Heating & House Comfort Solutions Combustion Optimization & Security Evaluation of your furnace consists of a Health & Safety Analysis, which examines the heat exchanger (carbon monoxide leaks and contaminated breathing air), checks the pilot security (surge risk), checks the high limit (fire danger) and includes a visual evaluation for other dangers.

<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional job finding the outside system as near your house as possible per my demand. The task took 2 days and my backyard and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was very experienced of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
<h3>AC Maintenance Cost in Lenexa KS</h3>
<p>If you believe a mold problem-- either since of visible growth or a moldy smell consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much great if it does not eliminate the mold. Mold starts with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can examine and maintain. Dripping return ducts can likewise introduce wetness. Again, if you presume a mold issue, think about having a service company examine the duct system for leaks.<p>

Heatpump move heat from outside the structure into the air inside. At first, heatpump HVAC systems were just used in moderate climates, however with improvements in low temperature operation and reduced loads due to more efficient homes, they are increasing in popularity in cooler environments.<p>
<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
