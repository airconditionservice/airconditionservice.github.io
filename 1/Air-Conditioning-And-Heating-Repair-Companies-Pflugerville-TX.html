Appropriate ventilation and elimination of the sources of these pollutants are essential in preserving excellent indoor air quality.<p>
<p>A routine furnace tune up can optimize performance and provide longer long lasting house heating. However, there are times when a simple maintenance call can recognize a problem that will require a considerable financial investment to fix. Then, it's decision time.
