<h3>Ductwork Insulation in Greeley CO</h3>

<p>The cost for heat pump installation also depends on the size of the system and whether it is a single-room or whole-home system. A single-room air-to-air system can cost as low as $500, consisting of installation. Whole-house systems, on the other hand, variety in rate from $2,500 to $7,500, including installation. Geothermal heat pumps normally need excavation to set up, which adds several thousand dollars to the cost.<p>
<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is often in the series of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), due to the fact that heatpump become inefficient in more severe cold. This is due to the fact that ice types on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system must momentarily change back into the regular cooling mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to make up for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
