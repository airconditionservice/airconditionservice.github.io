After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to buy stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of buy something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just crazy and all over the location and I guess they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
<p>The installation was quick, expert and very well done. The installers were polite and knew exactly what to do. I am an engineer by occupation and acknowledge easily individuals who are good at what they do. I was impressed with the installers as they are excellent and do not miss detail that produces a job very well done. I extremely extremely recommend the two gentlemen as they are outstanding at what they do. Thank you to them as they certainly deserve my thanks and gratitude for a task well done.<p>
