<p>The majority of central air conditioning conditioners are linked to a home's forced-air circulation system. Hence, the exact same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are utilized to disperse cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioner is operating, hot air inside your home flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool the house. When the air conditioning unit works but your home does not cool, the problem is probably in the distribution system.<p>
