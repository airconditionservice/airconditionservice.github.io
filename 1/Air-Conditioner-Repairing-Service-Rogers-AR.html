<p>The instructions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfortable completing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the brand-new breaker and last connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We recommend you do the very same. Once the circuitry is complete, energize the system for a couple of minutes to ensure the controls work and resistance cable television heats. Don't put the system into full operation until the thin-set and grout have had time to appropriately cure and solidify-- normally 2 to four weeks. Then call the family together and play a video game of Scrabble on your relaxing, warm restroom flooring.<p>
