<p>It's not recommended for uncertified people to repair & check air conditioning & HVAC devices. There is a danger of electric shock & death if not correctly trained in emergency ac repair check-ups. It would be best if you left it to a skilled ac repair Houston Midtown tech for correct HVAC diagnosis. Always make certain when checking your air conditioning devices to shut off all primary power from the emergency breaker panel or disconnect switch. Be extremely cautious when examining capacitors, even with the a/c system off. Capacitors can hold a high voltage charge, even with the power switched off. An unanticipated discharge from an air conditioning capacitor can cause extreme injury or death.<p>
<p>Even if your central air conditioning conditioner is just 8 to ten years old, it might flatter two times the electricity that even a low-end new one would utilize.

Up until 2006, 10 SEER was standard, however nowadays, the minimum allowed by federal law is 13 SEER. That translates to 30% less electrical intake and 30% lower cooling bills than equipment installed just a couple of years earlier.<p>
