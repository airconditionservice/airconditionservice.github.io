<p>I usually don't leave reviews however wanted to share my experience. You don't expect having to replace your AC system. Sadly for us, we had no other choice. What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long way. Other companies would arrange a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert going over my choices. After company hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and discuss options. I arranged my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their method. We were referred by a household pal and now I will suggest this company to my pals.<p>
