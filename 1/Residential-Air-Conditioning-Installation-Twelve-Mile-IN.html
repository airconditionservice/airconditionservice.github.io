<p>All homes need reliable ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more typical than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it might be that your pilot light has been stressed out from usage. Another possible factor could be a broken thermostat, avoiding the furnace from adjusting to the correct temperature level. Heaters that kick on frequently might be due to a dirty filter, which is not allowing the furnace to cycle air effectively. If your furnace is making a great deal of racket when it turns on or is humming, there may be an internal concern. While humming is caused by a slipped belt in the internal operations, other noises such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled or even an unclean burner.<p>
