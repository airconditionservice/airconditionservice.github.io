<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & A/c company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Sound since 1978. The choice of indoor units has one restriction: their total power must not exceed the capacity of the outdoor unit.

He remained up until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
