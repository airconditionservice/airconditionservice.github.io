<p>Indoor impurities. These consist of chemicals used in the building and construction or restoration of buildings (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning substances). In addition, devices that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide Incomplete combustion and poor ventilation of these devices (cook stoves, gas heaters, gas boilers, and gas hot water heater) can contribute to indoor impurities. Gas cook tops should be utilized with fans that send exhaust outside. Gas-fired heating devices must be sealed and power-vented systems installed to eliminate products of insufficient combustion.
