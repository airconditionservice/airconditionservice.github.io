<p>EER means Energy Efficiency Ratio. The energy efficiency of central air conditioning units is determined by the number of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set variety of conditions. As discussed above, a BTU is a standard system of heat; it is specified as the amount of heat needed to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The common set conditions are outside temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temp of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why the majority of people do not use this measurement much any longer.<p>
<p>Next, and possibly simply as crucial when it concerns central air expenses, is the AC system's size. An unit that is too large will have a simple time keeping the house cool, however will have a more difficult time getting rid of humidity from the air. On the other hand, a system that is too little will not have the ability to appropriately cool the home on hot days. Considering larger systems cost more than smaller systems, it pays to ask a local HVAC expert what size AC unit your central air system requires to hold.<p>
