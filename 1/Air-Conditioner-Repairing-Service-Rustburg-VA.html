<p>Though it may be hard to believe, the air inside your home can be worse than the air outside. Dust and dander are notorious for reducing the air quality in your house, however there are numerous other pollutants that can not only dirty up the air, but cause other health problems. Radon and carcinogens from cleaning materials and structure products add to poor air quality, and can likewise cause cancers. VOCs (unpredictable organic compounds) from paint and even from some kinds of carpets and upholstery materials can trigger problems. Mold and cigarette smoke can be perpetrators, too.<p>
<p>Next, and maybe just as crucial when it comes to central air costs, is the AC system's size. A system that is too big will have a simple time keeping the home cool, however will have a more difficult time removing humidity from the air. On the other hand, a system that is too small will not be able to correctly cool the home on hot days. Thinking about bigger units cost more than smaller sized systems, it pays to ask a local HVAC professional what size AC unit your central air system requires to hold.<p>
<p>Central air conditioners, often described as central air" or split-system a/c", circulate cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and signs up (i.e., openings in the floorings, ceilings, or walls covered by grills) carry cooled air from the ac system to the home. This cooled air ends up being warmer as it flows through the home; then it flows back to the central air conditioner through return ducts and registers. Learn how central air conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
