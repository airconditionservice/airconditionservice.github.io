<h3>How To Soundproof a Central Heating System in Goodview VA</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Effectiveness (97%) Phoenix Light Responsibility 50 gallon hot water heater. It went excellent. Working with Braxten was a satisfaction. We got a quote for 3 different hot water heater. Two on demand tankless and one high effectiveness tank. The crew took the whole day as they needed to remove the old hot water heater and set up all new venting, gas lines for the new high efficiency heater. We selected getting something more pricey than a conventional hot water heater as gas is among our most significant energy expenditures. We feel that this new system will last a long time and use really little energy to heat water.<p>
<p>Current Review: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and experienced. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>

<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company because the 2 specialists I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, neat, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
