<p>The primary issue when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external system to the internal ones. While setting up a different split system, employees try to find both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little.

The first models of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not allow you to set the a/c separately for each room. However, now the market has a large choice of multi-split systems, in which the functional attributes of indoor systems operate independently from each other.<p>
