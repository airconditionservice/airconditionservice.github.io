This means that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is likewise essential to routinely clean up the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will eventually lead to harm to the compressor, due to the fact that the condenser coil is responsible for releasing both the indoor heat (as gotten by the evaporator) and the heat produced by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
