<h3>Working of a HVAC System at Annandale VA</h3>
<p>Many people do not understand how humidity is gotten rid of from your Houston Midtown Tx house. The evaporator HVAC coil in your attic also acts a dehumidifier. All the wet hot air that goes through your HVAC coil, condenses. That humidity is then removed from the space that is being cooled. If your HVAC system is not draining pipes properly, you'll have a water leak. A limitation in your drainage pipes causes a water leakage. There are many different locations a blockage can occur. One of the primary locations where blockages begin to develop is inside your evaporator HVAC coil.<p>
