<p>It prevails to presume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, fairly stable over time. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment).

Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
