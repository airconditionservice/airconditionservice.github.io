<p>Correct ventilation helps enhance indoor air quality. It's simple to believe that the air quality exterior is worse than the air quality inside. We understand about air contamination and acid rain, we can see smoke and odor exhaust, and we may even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck gush thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air toxins are typically 2 to 5 times higher than outside levels, and in many cases these levels can surpass 100 times that of outdoor levels of the very same contaminants. Simply put, in some cases the air inside can be more hazardous than the air outside.<p>
<p>The factor for keeping the heat source low is simple. Heat rises, so it makes good sense to locate the heat source at the floor level. This lets the warmth naturally take a trip through the hot" zone, which is from an individual's toe to head area. All objects in the hot zone reach stability in temperature level after the convected heat system has been operating for a while, including people. Gone is that rush of hot air when the furnace begins and that abrupt shot of coolness when it shuts down.<p>

<p>Indoor contaminants. These include chemicals used in the building and construction or restoration of structures (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning compounds). In addition, appliances that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide gas Insufficient combustion and poor ventilation of these devices (cook stoves, gas heating systems, gas boilers, and gas hot water heater) can add to indoor contaminants. Gas cook tops must be used with fans that send exhaust exterior. Gas-fired heating home appliances ought to be sealed and power-vented systems installed to remove items of incomplete combustion. Wood-burning stoves can also create particulates and need to be vented outside.<p>
<p>Unstable organic substances (VOCs)-- These are the main contributors to bad indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both inside your home and outdoors. VOCs are natural chemicals produced as gases from items or processes; for the most part, you can smell their presence. Typical sources of VOCs indoors include things like cleaning representatives, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as seemingly innocuous as a brand-new carpet is most likely to be releasing formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outdoors might consist of volatile chemicals in contaminated groundwater that are pulled inside during water usage.<p>
