<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Simply today I saw I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the same day. He understood just what the issue was and fixed it extremely rapidly.

<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you may believe. Because a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a small, economical flexible hose pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to wear and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
<p>When the heat pump went out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was extremely valuable in gathering information on the phone and providing clear instructions about how to briefly deal with the problem and prepare the heat pump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was remarkably effective and provided clear interaction about the issue, its remedies, and its future avoidance. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd prepared for, and the service was professional and friendly. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will certainly use Integrity Energy Systems once again, for office and house.<p>
