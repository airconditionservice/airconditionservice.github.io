<h3>Residential HVAC in Fairless Hills PA</h3>
<p>We called Elite HVACS on one of the most popular days of summer season( we had no central air conditioning for 2weeks) and they sent out some1 out very same day to evaluate circumstance & decided to go with them for the work. I am happy to state that not just did we get the central air conditioning going however likewise changed the heating unit which was old. Everybody we talked with from starting to end were very professional, considerate and the work was very efficiently done. I would highly advise this company.<p>
<p>EER means Energy Efficiency Ratio. The energy efficiency of central air conditioning units is determined by the number of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set series of conditions. As pointed out above, a BTU is a traditional unit of heat; it is specified as the quantity of heat needed to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The normal set conditions are outdoor temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temp of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why most people do not use this measurement much any longer.<p>
<p>3. Gas Heating systems While the cost of heating your home with a gas furnace is normally higher than many heat pump choices, they can still be highly efficient, depending upon the design you buy. Among the main advantages of gas heating is that due to the combustion process, it will heat the air to higher temperature levels than other heating choices. This indicates it can warm up your home to the desired temperature level quicker than a heatpump can.<p>
<p>This evaluation is for changing a 17 years of age AC with a new AC, humidifier, air purification system and thermostat.
