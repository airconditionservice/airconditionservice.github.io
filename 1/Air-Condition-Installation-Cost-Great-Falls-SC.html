<p>When the heat pump went out in our offices, Taylor at Stability was extremely useful in collecting information on the phone and providing clear guidelines about how to momentarily manage the issue and prepare the heat pump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was incredibly efficient and provided clear interaction about the problem, its remedies, and its future prevention.

<p>Individuals working in buildings with bad IAQ might discover undesirable or moldy smells or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about symptoms that take place at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more serious issue. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ issues. Talk to your medical professional about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting even worse. However not all direct exposures cause symptoms, so there is no substitute for good building management.<p>
<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a need for air conditioning unit repair, which you must keep an eye out for. Initially, you must inspect your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little unreasonable, however ice on your air conditioner can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
