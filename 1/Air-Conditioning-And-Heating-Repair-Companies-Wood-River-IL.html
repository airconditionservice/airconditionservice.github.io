The ability to cool and heat your home at optimal efficiency will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is currently and the size of your house.

Also a house with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no fractures for air circulation will require far less AC capability to keep temperature levels comfy. Other factors that can affect this could be the insulation somewhere else such as the foundation, roofing system, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>

<p>Ducted heat pump cooling and heating systems act much like standard central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas through a duct system. If your house or building has an existing duct system that is in good shape, a ducted heat pump system may be most affordable. Utilizing existing ductwork will remove the need to set up an expensive new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>The probability of immediate responses to indoor air toxins depends upon numerous aspects. Age and preexisting medical conditions are 2 important influences. In other cases, whether an individual reacts to a pollutant depends on individual level of sensitivity, which differs significantly from individual to individual. Some individuals can end up being sensitized to biological toxins after repeated exposures, and it appears that some individuals can end up being sensitized to chemical contaminants too.<p>
<p>Irritants are materials that trigger an immune-type response in people who are sensitized to these products. Irritants discovered in indoor air are mostly biological material such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect bug particles, pollen, germs, and mold. All of these materials are little particles, can become airborne, and thus, are easily breathed in. Irritants that are breathed in by sensitized people with asthma can trigger asthma attacks. For example, if you think of a group of people with asthma, the presence of cat irritant could cause an asthma attack in individuals with cat allergic reactions, however not in those people who do not have feline allergic reactions.<p>
