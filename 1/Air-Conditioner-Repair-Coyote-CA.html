<p>Packaged terminal air conditioner (PTAC) systems are also called wall-split air conditioning systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are often utilized in hotels, have two different units (terminal bundles), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing system on the outside, with an opening passing through the wall and connecting them. This lessens the interior system footprint and enables each space to be changed separately. PTAC systems may be adjusted to supply heating in cold weather, either directly by using an electric strip, gas, or other heating system, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to draw and heat the interior heat from the outside air, transforming the a/c into a heatpump While space cooling provides maximum flexibility, when used to cool many spaces at a time it is typically more expensive than central air conditioning.<p>
