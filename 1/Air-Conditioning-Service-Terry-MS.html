<p>In addition, radiators heat the air nearest them initially, which is why rooms heated up by radiators are susceptible to cold spots", implying that the air feels cold in the middle of the space and very hot beside the radiators. This normally leads to opening a window above the radiator to bring some fresh air in, and there we go once again, letting all that energy paid to warm up the house escape out of the window.
