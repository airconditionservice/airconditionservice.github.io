Likewise, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted immediately, and when I changed my AC, they made 2 journeys to collaborate their work with a company that was dealing with the outdoor patio where the unit sits. I feel like they provide me preferential treatment, and am willing to pay a little more for that comfort.<p>
