<h3>What is HVAC? HVAC Advice For South Bend IN Home Owners</h3>

Failure to replace these filters as needed will add to a lower heat currency exchange rate, resulting in lost energy, shortened devices life, and higher energy expenses; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air flow. In addition, very filthy or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system and even fire.<p>
