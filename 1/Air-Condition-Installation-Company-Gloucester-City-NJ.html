<p>Weatherization typically does not cause indoor air problems by adding new contaminants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can often emit pollutants.) However, procedures such as setting up storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can minimize the quantity of outdoor air penetrating into a house. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Co2 (CO2) may not be the most pernicious aspect impacting indoor air quality, but it is often utilized as a surrogate for air quality and structure occupancy level. The more occupants there are in a room or building, the more CO2 is launched into the air. To prevent CO2 levels from rising too high-- which can have an unfavorable effect on residents-- outside air must be intentionally brought into the building through a ventilation system.<p>
