<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire living space. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning aid determine the efficiency of dilution. Air modifications result from a mix of natural ventilation (seepage; leak; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove moisture, Air cleaning happens. The goal is to offer adequate modifications to guarantee a healthy environment. There are several types of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be installed to accomplish this.
