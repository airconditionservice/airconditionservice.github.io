Less than 24 hours after I called him, I was definitely appreciative to have a heated house again. What's most amazing was that this all occurred during Thanksgiving week! I wasn't sure we 'd find somebody to help us right before a vacation, however Climate Pro came through for us. I will gladly recommend this company to my pals.<p>
