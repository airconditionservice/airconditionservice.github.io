<p>Many central air conditioning conditioners are connected to a home's forced-air distribution system.

The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your home. When the air conditioner works but your home does not cool, the issue is probably in the circulation system.<p>
