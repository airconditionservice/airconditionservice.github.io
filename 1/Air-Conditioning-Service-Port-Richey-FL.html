Message the pro to discover out what those services include if you come throughout a profile that specifies the HVAC technician or AC expert is providing remote services.<p>
<p>Many central air conditioning conditioners are connected to a home's forced-air distribution system. Therefore, the same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to disperse cool air from the a/c system. When a central air conditioner is running, hot air inside your home streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your home. When the air conditioner works but your home does not cool, the issue is probably in the circulation system.<p>
