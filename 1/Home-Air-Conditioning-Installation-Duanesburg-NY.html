<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a fairly easy to measure surrogate for indoor pollutants produced by humans, and associates with human metabolic activity.

<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't lucrative you would not use them.  Second of all like extended car guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is actually sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the essential skills to do the task and likewise the morals to deal with clients relatively. As a customer you need to be well informed in order not to be entirely taken advantage of. A lot of companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to properly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Lastly discovered someone to appropriately service and the unit has actually been operating problem complimentary for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>

<p>It is common to presume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady over time. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a building as reasonably the same physical material with time. In truth, the real nature of buildings can be viewed as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be explained and comprehended as complicated systems. Research study using the methods ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
