<p>When installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external unit to the internal ones, the primary problem. While installing a different split system, employees attempt to locate both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Installing a multi-split system creates more troubles, because a few of indoor systems can be located far from the exterior. The very first designs of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not enable you to set the cooling individually for each room. However, now the market has a large choice of multi-split systems, in which the functional qualities of indoor systems run independently from each other.<p>
