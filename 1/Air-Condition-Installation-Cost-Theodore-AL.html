<p>Heating is the biggest energy expense in the typical house. In very dry climates, evaporative coolers, in some cases referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness throughout heat. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a wet pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the inbound air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is decreased. The temperature of the inbound air is decreased, but it is likewise more humid, so the total heat (sensible heat plus latent heat) is the same. Some of the practical heat of the going into air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. If the entering air is dry enough, the results can be quite significant.<p>

<h3>How Central Heating Boilers Maintain Your Theodore AL Home Toasty Warm</h3>
<p>Many residential heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The current trend in home construction is to decrease air leakage through cracks and other openings in floorings, walls, and roofs. The combination of these building practices and the recirculation of indoor air has actually caused a boost in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside makeup air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living locations of residential buildings. The ASHRAE standards for make-up air for bathroom and kitchens in homes are much greater. This fresh make-up air waters down indoor pollutants and assists tire them from the house.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the demand to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently performed in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
