<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider because the two technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

The technician who discussed our choices did an excellent job in making sure we comprehended the pros and cons of each choice. The specialists who set up the new system were expert and quick, while taking some time to make sure we comprehended how the new system worked. Overall a very first rate experience.<p>
