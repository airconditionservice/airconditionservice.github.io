<p>Sean was extremely valuable. He is an extremely enjoyable person to work with. No pressure applied to buy additional stuff. Addressed all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He was able to put rise protectors on the unit and do the full maintenance on the unit. that was to make sure they were no problems other than the blower motor. The only factor he might not install the brand-new blower motor was because there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he knows for sure what the problem is.<p>
<p>Examine these 3 things first if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make certain all the signs up in your home are broad open. Then be sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outdoors and clean off the condenser coils (Image 2). If numerous signs up were closed or the filter was clogged, the minimized air flow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. If you have actually altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or up until there's good air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. You've resolved the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
