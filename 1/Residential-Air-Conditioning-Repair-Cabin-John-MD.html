<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider since the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
