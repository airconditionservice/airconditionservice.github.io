<p>Radiant heating covers a range of various heating systems, consisting of electric heaters and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heat systems run on similar concepts. In the case of a boiler, the system warms by dispersing hot water through a series of pipes installed in the sub-floor of each room. In the case of electric radiant heat systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating components. As the hot water (or electrical energy) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the floor and into the room.<p>

<p>A geothermal heating unit is more reputable than options, and is not affected by any external aspects, unlike other renewable energies such as wind energy and solar power. For instance, wind energy can only be used when there is wind, while solar power depends on regular sunshine to work effectively. Geothermal heating is dependent on neither the wind nor the sun, but instead takes its heat from the earth's crust, which is always hot. This makes geothermal heating a readily available and trustworthy  source of energy.<p>
