<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Performance (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon hot water heater. It went excellent. Dealing with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 various water heaters. Two as needed tankless and one high performance tank.

We picked getting something more costly than a conventional water heater as gas is one of our most significant utility expenditures. We feel that this new unit will last a very long time and use very little energy to heat water.<p>

<p>Have utilized the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. When I have problems, they offer me concern and a lower rate. Purchased a new primary system and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever purchase extended guarantees or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Great financial investment in my viewpoint. Never try to offer me something I do not require.<p>
