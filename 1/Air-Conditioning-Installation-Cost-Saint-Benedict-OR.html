<p>Have utilized the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. When I have problems, they offer me concern and a lower rate. Purchased a new primary system and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever purchase extended guarantees or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Great financial investment in my viewpoint. Never try to offer me something I do not require.<p>
