<p>If you need furnace operate in West Seattle and do not user James Heating, you are a covidiot. Our furnace went down with a broken igniter, and no one else might come except for SW. They came and stated it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the job, but they had to purchase it. My partner stated that she had seen an excellent review for James, so I called. He can be found in a few hours (weaving a mask) and explained the situation to me. He said it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 total. He used to come back today, but I moved it to tomorrow. James is one of the best, most good people I have satisfied in a very long time. If we want to have options to ACME heating, we need to support the genuine individuals who are there for us. Please do.<p>

<p>I am extremely impressed with this company. Among my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the issue within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call company many years back and know the importance of having the best parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm likewise amazed that he showed up at my home at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will absolutely be using Waycoff's once again, and would advise them to everyone. Thank You very much.<p>
