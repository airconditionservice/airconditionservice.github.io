<p>In a typical residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar made to his staff members, devices costs, marketing, energies, and other expenditures prior to paying himself anything. Typically this leaves about 6% of profits to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This doesn't sound like much, especially if the objective of owning a company was for monetary liberty. Plus, this 6% is after the couple of years it required to construct the business and not taking an income as the owner. However, this 6% typically isn't the end objective.
