<p>Award Winning Plumbing and HVAC Services. Lots of common building products utilized prior to 1975 consist of asbestos, such as some flooring tiles, ceiling tiles, shingles, fireproofing, heating unit, pipeline wrap, taping muds, mastics, and other insulation products. Normally, significant releases of asbestos fiber do not happen unless the structure materials are disturbed, such as by cutting, sanding, drilling, or building remodelling.

A management program for intact asbestos-containing materials is often suggested instead.<p>
<p>A blocked furnace filter can trigger a furnace to shut off. Filthy filters are the most common reason for furnace issues. Dust and dirt limit airflow-- and if the filter gets too stopped up, the heat exchanger will shut and overheat off too quickly, and your home won't warm up. If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, change the filter. A filthy filter also causes soot buildup on the heat exchanger, reducing the effectiveness of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>
