<p>Instead of incorporating to the ducts in your home, a mini-split heatpump has an indoor head unit that installs on a wall. A ductless system has a built-in performance advantage due to the fact that up to 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC unit might be lost to leaks in your ducts. Since they don't require any new ductwork to be installed, ductless heat pumps are terrific for additions. Because an unit is installed in each room or location you wish to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensors that automatically raise the temperature in the space when you exist.<p>

<p>To put this simply, Preventative maintenance is IMPORTANT TO preserve the performance and efficiency of your HVAC system, several studies through DOE and ACCA can confirm this if you're interested. Nevertheless, select your contractor sensibly, much of the 'credible' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not immune to inappropriate sales strategies that DO benefit from uninformed homeowners. Once again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid site with a program. While Angie's list is a good base line indication that you MIGHT be dealing with a respectable company, you still should do your homework (not all contractors with a similar rating are the same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (A/c contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>Biological pollutants include germs, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and feline saliva, house allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these toxins. Pollens stem from plants; viruses are transferred by animals and individuals; bacteria are brought by individuals, animals, and soil and plant debris; and household pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a powerful irritant. When it dries, it can end up being airborne. Polluted central air handling systems can end up being breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then disperse these impurities through the house.<p>
