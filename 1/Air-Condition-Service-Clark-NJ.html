<p>To be sincere, few of the facilities supervisors who use our indoor air quality monitoring service pertained to us for that reason. Typically they were at first thinking about remotely monitoring some other aspect of their buildings, such as energy use, in an effort to cut expenses. It wasn't till later on, as they continued dealing with us, that they discovered and executed indoor air quality monitoring to supply a much healthier, much safer structure environment-- and to head off the unfavorable effects associated with indoor air toxins.<p>
<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have extremely little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the auto debit, although my company does not provide car debit lots of companies do so they can have a known quantity of money being available in each month, it assists with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. If we do choose to provide auto debit we would likewise have an option of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There ought to not be any reason your company can not provide this. Hope this helps.<p>
