Sources of formaldehyde in the home include structure products, smoking, household items, and the use of unvented, fuel-burning devices, like gas ranges or kerosene space heating units.

<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to complete. I 'd priced out new units and installation for months. Once I decided to final progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Heap unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not just was the rate excellent however Mark went out of his way to tailor a few things in my home to make the overall air circulation more optimized. I believe it actually only took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I believe any future business related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
