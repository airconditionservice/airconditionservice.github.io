Move to another contractor if your contractor says they understand the size of air conditioning system you require based on experience or on square video footage alone. As with determining the size of an unit needed based on BTUs, determining the appropriate size of unit for your home likewise depends upon the system load-- how much cold air it will lose by room.<p>
