<p>A specific air conditioner that is used only for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also uses a refrigeration cycle, but differs from a standard air conditioning unit in that both the condenser and the evaporator are placed in the exact same air path. A standard air conditioning system transfers heat energy out of the room since its condenser coil launches heat outside. However, given that all elements of the dehumidifier remain in the very same space, no heat is eliminated. Rather, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier remains in the room as heat, so the room is really warmed, simply as by an electric heating unit that draws the very same amount of power.<p>
