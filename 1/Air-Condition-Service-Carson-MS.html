<p>The evaporator coil is probably frozen. The cause is generally an absence of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is brought on by a plugged filter. Without air flow, wetness from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC system, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and try again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>

<p>Ducted heat pump heating & cooling systems act much like traditional central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces via a duct system. If your home or structure has an existing duct system that is in good shape, a ducted heat pump system might be most economical. Using existing ductwork will eliminate the need to set up a pricey brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>

It may impact the cardiovascular system and some studies have actually connected direct exposure to previously owned smoke with the start of chest pain. For publications about ETS, go to the IAQ Publications page, or contact EPA's Indoor Air Quality Information Clearinghouse (IAQ INFO), 800-438-4318 or (703) 356-4020.<p>
