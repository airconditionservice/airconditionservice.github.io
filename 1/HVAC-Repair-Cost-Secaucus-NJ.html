<p>The very first a/c unit and fridges utilized flammable or poisonous gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or propane, that could lead to deadly accidents when they leaked.

I scheduled my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a family buddy and now I will suggest this company to my buddies.<p>
