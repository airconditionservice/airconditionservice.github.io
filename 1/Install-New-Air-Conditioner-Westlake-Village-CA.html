<p>My home has 5 systems, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" found something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned up for an additional $30.00. (He actually stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I complained and got a refund) When this guy belittled me for my "not comprehending", I tossed him off the property.<p>

<p>Your lungs are accountable for bringing fresh air into your body, while at the same time getting rid of waste gases and particulates. Needless to say, the more particles that are in the air you breathe, the harder it is for your lungs to remove them. Poor air quality - whether it is inside your home or outdoors - can make it significantly challenging for your lungs to operate appropriately, and can have negative health impacts.<p>
<p>Replacing a capacitor is easy. Just take a photo of the wires before disconnecting anything (you might require a recommendation in the future). Then release the saved energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp connectors must snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. Eliminate the adapter and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. Secure the new capacitor (Picture 5) when you have actually swapped all the wires.<p>
