<h3>Understanding the Essentials of Furnace, AC and HVAC Maintenance at Fruitport MI</h3>
<p>Another method to reducing the concentrations of indoor air toxins in your home is to increase the amount of outside air coming inside. A lot of house heating and cooling systems, including required air heater, do not mechanically bring fresh air into your home. Opening windows and doors, operating window or attic fans, when the weather condition permits, or running a window air conditioning system with the vent control open boosts the outside ventilation rate. Local restroom or kitchen area fans that exhaust outdoors get rid of contaminants directly from the space where the fan lies and also increase the outdoor air ventilation rate.<p>
<p>AC air handler screeching or grinding noises. Though many air handlers have direct-drive motors, some older units might be belt-driven. Screeching noises from a belt-drive air handler typically occur when the belt that connects the motor to the blower slips. For the most part, the belt is improperly lined up or used and requires replacement. Follow the directions above under Air Conditioner Not Blowing Air and refer to your owner's manual.<p>

<p>Ducted heat pump heating and cooling systems act just like standard central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces via a duct system. If your house or building has an existing duct system that is in great shape, a ducted heat pump system might be most affordable. Using existing ductwork will get rid of the requirement to install a costly new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
