<p>Many central air conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air distribution system. Therefore, the same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to distribute cool air from the air conditioning system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is operating, hot air inside your home streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your home. When the air conditioning system works but the house does not cool, the issue is probably in the circulation system.<p>
