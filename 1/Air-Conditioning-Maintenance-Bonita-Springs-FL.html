In this case, the heat pump is used effectively during the milder temperatures, and the system is switched to the standard heat source when the outdoor temperature level is lower.<p>
<p>The condensate drain in your air conditioning system and heatpump need to be free of all blockages and particles.

Excess wetness can trigger problems like mold, water damage, high levels of humidity in the residential or commercial property, unequal temperature regulation, bacteria, and compromised air quality. An expert maintenance technician will flush and clean the condensate drain to ensure all excess moisture flows away from the system.<p>
