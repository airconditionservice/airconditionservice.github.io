<p>UW visitors, students and staff members must have a tidy, healthy environment in which to work, study and perform numerous activities. If the air quality is bad it can affect an individual's health, efficiency, and convenience.

A key part of the program is reacting to and fixing issues of building residents about problems in their workplace.<p>
<p>Cooling can likewise be offered by a procedure called totally free cooling which utilizes pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is included due to the fact that the temperature of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, thus declining its efficiency.<p>
