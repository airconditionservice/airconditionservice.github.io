<p>The guidelines that included the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfy finishing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the new breaker and final connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We suggest you do the exact same.

Don't put the system into complete operation until the thin-set and grout have had time to properly treat and solidify-- usually two to 4 weeks. Then call the household together and play a game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm bathroom floor.<p>
