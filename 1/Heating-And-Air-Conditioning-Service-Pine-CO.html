<p>Have utilized the same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. When I have issues, they offer me concern and a lower rate. Purchased a new primary unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever buy extended warranties or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Excellent investment in my viewpoint. Never attempt to offer me something I don't require.<p>
