Throughout the 1970s, lots of property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation step. However, many of these homes were discovered to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this item.
