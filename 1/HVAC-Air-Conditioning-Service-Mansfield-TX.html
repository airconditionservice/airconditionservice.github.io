<p>When they're shut down and then repowered, ac units and thermostats have built-in hold-up functions. The hold-up can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you've signed up for an energy-saving gadget from your local power energy, the system can take even longer to reset.

Prior to checking the run relay, switch off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, disassemble the relay and pry apart the contacts. This should suffice till you buy a replacement-- which you need to do quickly.<p>
