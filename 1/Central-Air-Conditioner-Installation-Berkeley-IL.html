<p>A packaged unit, normally set up on the roofing system, is most typically used on commercial structures, but it is likewise a choice for homeowners to think about. Oftentimes, these units consist of not only the air conditioning unit itself but also a furnace. An advantage of this system is certainly the cost. Packaged units are excellent for those wanting to conserve money on the installation of a brand-new heating & cooling system individually, because the unit is integrated. However, one con is that these units are normally just available for bigger homes due to their high power and capacity. In addition, while they can be an excellent way to conserve money on a total HVAC system, they're still significantly more expensive than purchasing just a cooling system. Therefore, this may not be the very best alternative for house owners trying to find short-term savings or those with smaller sized spending plans.<p>
