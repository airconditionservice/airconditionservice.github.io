<p>When installing over concrete pieces, we suggest utilizing our insulation boards. When used in combination with underfloor heating by acting as a very efficient thermal barrier, Warmup Insulation Boards will save you cash. They reflects the heat upwards into the flooring tile instead of allowing heat to heat up the concrete slab listed below. By utilizing Warmup Insulation Boards you will discover that after switching on your heating, your flooring tiles will warm up in about 10-15 minutes. Without insulation boards it could take anything from 2-3 hours, or more.<p>
<p>The guidelines that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfortable completing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the new breaker and final connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We recommend you do the exact same.

Do not put the system into full operation till the thin-set and grout have had time to correctly solidify and treat-- usually 2 to 4 weeks. Then call the household together and play a game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm restroom floor.<p>
