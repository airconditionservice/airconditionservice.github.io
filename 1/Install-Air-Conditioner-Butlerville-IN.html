<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to finish. I 'd evaluated new systems and installation for months. When I decided to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Ton unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not only was the cost terrific but Mark went out of his way to tailor a couple of things in my house to make the general air circulation more optimized. I think it literally only took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I believe any future company related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
