<p>A packaged unit, generally set up on the roofing, is most commonly utilized on commercial structures, however it is likewise a choice for property owners to think about. Many times, these units consist of not just the air conditioning unit itself but also a furnace. A benefit of this system is certainly the cost. Packaged systems are great for those looking to conserve cash on the installation of a brand-new cooling and heating system separately, considering that the unit is integrated.
