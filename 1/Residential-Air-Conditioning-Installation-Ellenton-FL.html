After evaluating 33 homes in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no substantial improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy effectiveness. In some cases, determined particle levels actually increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced immediately after cleaning however went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>Both must be kept tidy because an air conditioner moves heat in between the outside coil and the indoor coil. This indicates that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is likewise needed to frequently clean the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser tidy will ultimately lead to damage to the compressor, due to the fact that the condenser coil is responsible for releasing both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat produced by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
