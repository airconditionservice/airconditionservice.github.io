After testing 33 houses in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the study discovered that there was no significant enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy performance. In many cases, determined particle levels actually increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased right away after cleaning however went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
