<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an exceptional job finding the outside system as near the house as possible per my request. The task took 2 days and my backyard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely knowledgeable of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed up until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
