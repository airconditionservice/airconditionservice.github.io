<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You ought to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have really small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the automobile debit, although my company does not use auto debit numerous companies do so they can have a recognized amount of cash being available in each month, it assists with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. If we do decide to use vehicle debit we would likewise have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There should not be any reason your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>
