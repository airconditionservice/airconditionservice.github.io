<p>Moreover, radiators heat the air nearest them initially, which is why spaces warmed by radiators are vulnerable to cold areas", meaning that the air feels cold in the middle of the space and really hot next to the radiators. This typically results in opening a window above the radiator to bring some fresh air in, and there we go again, letting all that energy paid to warm up the house escape out of the window. Radiant heat provides warmth from the flooring up throughout the space with no cold spots or stuffiness in the area being warmed.<p>
<p>If your single stage a/c unit isn't old sufficient to justify replacement, consider a whole house dehumidifier. By installing dehumidification devices inside an existing single stage system, you can enjoy some of the benefits of a variable speed compressor without replacing any equipment. The dehumidifier will keep your relative humidity at a comfortable level, enhancing indoor air quality and allowing higher comfort at greater temperature levels.<p>
<p>Since my furnace was not working, I called Snowflake Air. Jose and his assistant got here on time. Jose hung around repairing the issue, all the while explaining everything to me. After finding the thermostat was not working properly. He had to go get the proper replacement. After the installation of the new thermostat, Jose discussed the operation and programing to me. I will certainly utilize Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
