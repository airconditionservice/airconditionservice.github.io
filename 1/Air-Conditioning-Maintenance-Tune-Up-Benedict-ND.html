<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may believe. Since the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive versatile hose) instead of stiff square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to tear and wear and is quickly pierced.<p>
<p>When you purchase a new heating & cooling system, you're buying your house, your family, and your service.

<p>Think about an entire home dehumidifier if your single phase air conditioner isn't old sufficient to justify replacement.
