<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have very small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing.

<h3>How Do Air Heat Pump Works in Chester SC?</h3>
<p>Geothermal heatpump are exceptionally effective, because ground source heating is drawn out from depths where the temperature is always at a continuous temperature. These systems can attain a geothermal efficiency of about 300 to 600 percent throughout the, Coldest winter nights; whereas air-source heatpump can just attain an efficiency of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter season. Much like other types of heat pumps, ground source heat pumps have their geothermal effectiveness rated according to their coefficient of performance (POLICE OFFICER). COP rates just how much heat a system gets rid of or produces (depending on whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus how much the system utilizes to produce the heating or cooling result. Most ground source heatpump have Polices of about 3.0 to 5.0. What this indicates is that for every single system of energy utilized by a geothermal heat pump, roughly 3 to 5 systems are provided back in the type of heat.<p>
<p>There's a big distinction in between the heat transfer of radiation and the other common type of house heating-- convection.

Convection is the process of heating air and blowing it about the spaces for the warm air to keep the ceilings, floors and walls warmed. In turn, the objects in the room, like furnishings and people, would remain warm by virtue of the air temperature.<p>
