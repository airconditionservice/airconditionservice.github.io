However, pick your contractor sensibly, a lot of the 'reputable' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not immune to inappropriate sales tactics that DO make the most of uninformed property owners.

The heat exchanger permits air to be warmed without coming in contact with the real flame or burner location. Once it reaches an adequate temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the house's duct, providing warm air to individual bed rooms, living spaces and kitchens through the vents or registers.<p>
