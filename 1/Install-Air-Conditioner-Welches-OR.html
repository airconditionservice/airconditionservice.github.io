The installer will be using the above noted devices, a Provider, Comfort Series Single Stage Condenser, 31,000 BTUs.

They will be adding 3 (3) high speed supply lines and recycle the existing 17 supply lines. They will also reuse the refrigerant lines and leave the R-11 refrigerant and replace with a R410 refrigerant. They will likewise set up a Honeywell 5000 programmable cooling thermostat. I also have an alternative for an additional $2,818.00 to install a Carrier Efficiency Series two-stage condenser (31,000 BTUs and a 14 SEER); a Unico two-stage blower module and a Unico R-410 Evaporator Coil module that are both ranked at 14 SEER and are 31,000 BTUs.<p>

<p>Evaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working during times of high humidity, when there is very little dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for dwelling residents.
