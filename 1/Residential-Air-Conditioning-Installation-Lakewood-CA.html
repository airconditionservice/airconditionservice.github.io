<p>Poor indoor air quality is typically triggered by the lack of sufficient ventilation, which leads to an accumulation of contaminants from sources in the home. The National Institute for Occupational Security and Health identified inadequate ventilation as the primary issue in more than half the workplace indoor air investigations it has performed. Investigations conducted in homes by the Illinois Department of Public Health have actually found the exact same to be true. These examinations exposed that proper ventilation is important in maintaining good indoor air quality.<p>
<p>This is particularly notable, as gas ranges can cause levels of pollution that would be prohibited outdoors. According to the EPA, while homes without gas ranges have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), houses with well-adjusted gas stoves have levels that can range from 5 to 15 ppm, and houses with inadequately adjusted gas stoves can be 30 ppm or higher.
