<p>We look at ideas before we provide advice to change rather than repair a heater. One of the clues we take a look at is the cost of energy. If energy costs are high compared to usage, or if energy expenses are higher every year, we know the unit is not running effectively. It may be in ideal condition, but if it costs you more in a year to operate than it would cost to replace it with a more effective design, then you would be squandering cash by not changing the older system.<p>

The 2 operations utilize different procedures, with geothermal energy requiring water be heated up to boiling point to accomplish its goals.<p>
