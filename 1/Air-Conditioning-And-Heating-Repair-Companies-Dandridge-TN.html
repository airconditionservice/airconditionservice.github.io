The technician invested a decent quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure.

They came and said it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the job, but they needed to order it. My partner said that she had seen a fantastic review for James, so I called. He came in a couple of hours (weaving a mask) and discussed the scenario to me. He stated it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 overall. He offered to come back today, however I moved it to tomorrow. James is one of the best, most decent people I have fulfilled in a long period of time.
