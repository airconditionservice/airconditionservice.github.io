Make sure to view the video initially prior to installation and follow all instructions precisely. , if you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.. We had issues with air bubble pockets. After getting in touch with assistance, we fixed problems. I would recommend this item to anyone who's redesigning or installing their bathroom for the very first time. Adding in a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench quickly.<p>
