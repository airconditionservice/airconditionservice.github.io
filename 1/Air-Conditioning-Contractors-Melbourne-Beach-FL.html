<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is connected to a remote condenser unit using refrigerant piping between an indoor and outdoor  system instead of ducting air directly from the outside system. Indoor systems with directional vents install onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or fit into the ceiling. Other indoor units install inside the ceiling cavity, so that brief lengths of duct deal with air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the rooms.<p>
<p>Initially, know that a bulk of your central air conditioning and unit cost will originate from the unit itself. AC unit costs start at $2,000 and can really surpass $10,000 for bigger houses. As you saw recently, you require an appropriately-sized unit for your home. Otherwise, the AC will break down quicker than anticipated or your month-to-month energy costs will increase.
