<p>1. Central Air Conditioning Source Heat Pumps Air source heat pumps work best in a mild climate, where the temperature doesn't get too low or too high. In other words, they are perfect for our Seattle environment! They are highly effective, beating out most other types of heating systems in performance. The only genuine exception to this would be a geothermal heatpump system. Nevertheless, a geothermal installation typically costs 10s of thousands more than an air source heat pump, which usually indicates it stops working in terms of return on investment.<p>

<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Simply this morning I saw I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the very same day. He knew just what the issue was and fixed it really quickly. But here is the BEST ONE. About 10 years ago my whole cooling and gas heat went completely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan had the ability to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so truthful, he might have charged me for so much more.<p>

<p>Next, and maybe simply as essential when it pertains to central air conditioning costs, is the AC unit's size. A system that is too large will have an easy time keeping the home cool, however will have a more difficult time getting rid of humidity from the air.
