<p>Air conditioning can also be offered by a process called complimentary cooling which utilizes pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heatpump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added because the temperature level of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, thus decreasing its efficiency.<p>
