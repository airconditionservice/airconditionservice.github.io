<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Discovered both within and outside, particle matter is a mix of solid particles and liquid droplets suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, pollen, and soot. The particles themselves are various sizes, but the ones to be most worried about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller sized-- due to the fact that they can be inhaled.
