<p>SysTech Design focuses on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for enhancing and maintaining the quality of the air around a commercial environment. The exact same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air before it circulates through your house. Condensed wetness can cause dust and other particles to stick to and build up on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils guarantees dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from building up on and beneath the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>
