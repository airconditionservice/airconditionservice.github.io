Most house heating and cooling systems, consisting of forced air heater, do not mechanically bring fresh air into your home. Opening doors and windows, operating window or attic fans, when the weather permits, or running a window ac system with the vent control open boosts the outdoor ventilation rate.

He understood simply what the issue was and repaired it really quickly. But here is the BEST ONE. About 10 years ago my whole air conditioning and gas heat went completely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan had the ability to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he might have charged me for a lot more.<p>
