In really dry climates, evaporative coolers, in some cases described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness throughout heat.

Some of the reasonable heat of the entering air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The results can be quite substantial if the entering air is dry enough.<p>

A radiator cools the engine by flowing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant streams. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine might damage the engine parts. To prevent this from happening, have your radiator serviced routinely.
