<h3>Indoor Air Conditioner in Plantation FL</h3>
<p>Some a/c systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also typically described as "reverse cycle air conditioner". The heatpump is considerably more energy effective than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, in addition to the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit also changes functions to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outside air).<p>
