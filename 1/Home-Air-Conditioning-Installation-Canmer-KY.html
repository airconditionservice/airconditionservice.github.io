<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively used in dry cleaning. In lab research studies, it has been shown to trigger cancer in animals. Recent studies suggest that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned products are stored and as they use dry-cleaned clothing.

Some dry cleaners, however, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to minimize your exposure to this chemical is prudent. Do not accept them up until they have actually been effectively dried if dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical smell when you select them up. Attempt a various dry cleaner if items with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent sees.<p>
