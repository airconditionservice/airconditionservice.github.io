<h3>Tips for Fast Furnace Repair at Quinton VA</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a federal government firm, carried out a research study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it lowers energy costs by improving air flow. After evaluating 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study discovered that there was no considerable improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy efficiency. In some cases, measured particle levels really increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced immediately after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
