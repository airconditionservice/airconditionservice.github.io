<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to complete. I 'd priced out new units and installation for months. As soon as I chose to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka.

Not just was the price fantastic but Mark headed out of his way to tailor a few things in my house to make the overall air circulation more enhanced.

Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heat pump to chill the flow originating from the storage.
