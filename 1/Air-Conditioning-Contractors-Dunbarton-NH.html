<p>The very first thing that you will really have to set up will be the air handler, which will be available in your central heating unit installation set.

<p>Moisture management and humidity control requires operating HVAC systems as created. Moisture management and humidity control may contravene efforts to try to optimize the operation to save energy. For example, wetness management and humidity control needs systems to be set to provide make-up air at lower temperatures (design levels), instead of the higher temperature levels in some cases used to conserve energy in cooling-dominated environment conditions. However, for the majority of the US and numerous parts of Europe and Japan, throughout the majority of hours of the year, outside air temperatures are cool enough that the air does not require more cooling to provide thermal convenience inside. Nevertheless, high humidity outdoors creates the requirement for careful attention to humidity levels indoors. High humidities give rise to mold growth and wetness inside your home is associated with a greater prevalence of occupant respiratory issues.<p>
