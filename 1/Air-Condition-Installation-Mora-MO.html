<p>EHSI's indoor air quality team masters incorporating a multidisciplinary technique to indoor air quality (IAQ) obstacles. When approximating the cost of an installation, a safe cost estimation bracket is in between $10 to $20 per square foot dependant on the kind of system you choose for your house.

<p>The most typical source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which houses are constructed. As uranium naturally breaks down, it releases radon gas which is a colorless, odor-free, radioactive gas. Radon gas gets in houses through dirt floors, cracks in concrete walls and floorings, flooring drains pipes, and sumps. When radon becomes caught in structures and concentrations develop inside your home, exposure to radon becomes a concern.<p>

<p>There are lots of sources of indoor air pollution in any house. These include combustion sources such as oil, gas, kerosene, wood, tobacco, and coal items; building products and home furnishings as varied as shabby, asbestos-containing insulation, damp or damp carpet, and kitchen cabinetry or furnishings made of certain pressed wood items; products for household cleaning and maintenance, individual care, or pastimes; central heating and cooling systems and humidification gadgets; and outside sources such as radon, pesticides, and outdoor air pollution.<p>
<p>Some health impacts may appear quickly after a single direct exposure or repeated exposures to a contaminant. These include inflammation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, lightheadedness, and tiredness. Such immediate results are treatable and normally short-term. In some cases the treatment is just eliminating the person's exposure to the source of the pollution, if it can be determined. Soon after direct exposure to some indoor air contaminants, signs of some diseases such as asthma might show up, be intensified or aggravated.<p>
<p>The majority of central air conditioning conditioners are connected to a home's forced-air circulation system. Thus, the same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to distribute cool air from the a/c system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is operating, hot air inside your house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your house. When the ac system works however the house does not cool, the problem is most likely in the circulation system.<p>
