<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a need for air conditioning unit repair, which you should watch out for. First, you should examine your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little absurd, but ice on your a/c can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly.<p>
