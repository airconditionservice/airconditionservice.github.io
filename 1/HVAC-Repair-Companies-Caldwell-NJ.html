<p>Old lead-based paint is the most considerable source of lead direct exposure in the U.S. today. Harmful direct exposures to lead can be produced when lead-based paint is incorrectly eliminated from surfaces by dry scraping, sanding, or open-flame burning.

<p>. The compressor-based refrigerant systems are air-cooled, indicating they use air to exchange heat, in the very same way as an automobile radiator or normal home ac system does.
