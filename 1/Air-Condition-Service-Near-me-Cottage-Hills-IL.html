<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might think. Due to the fact that the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, affordable versatile hose) rather of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to tear and use and is easily punctured.<p>
<p>Compounding the noted health symptoms might be task tension. In part, due to numerous aspects of workplace automation, the most demanding elements of office work are increasing. Health symptoms related to task stress include psychological and physical pressures such as aggravation, stress and anxiety, irritation, anger, anxiety, stomach or gastro-intestinal disruptions, and muscle and mental stress. These symptoms might be promoted by bad indoor quality.<p>
