<p>Oil heating units are less common now than natural gas, but they can be beneficial in more remote regions where energies are more difficult to gain access to, and in colder climates because it supplies more heat per BTU than other services. The installation cost will be lower, however energy expenses will be higher, as much as three times higher than gas or electric heaters.

<p>My "C" rating is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The unit runs quietly and efficiently, but to have 2 significant components fail in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (defrost control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were listed on the billing before work started. Parts were covered by warranty. Tax added another $53. The work was completed in less than two hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
<p>A geothermal heater does not generate its power by burning nonrenewable fuel sources such as coal, gas, or oil. Rather, it absorbs heat from within the earth. Moreover, a geothermal cooling and heating system utilizes significantly less electrical energy compared to a standard electric heat-resistance heatpump. This makes a geothermal heater an appealing solution to cut your carbon footprint, supplying a favorable influence on the environment.<p>
<p>We have been very happy with Stability's equipment (Trane dealer) and service (today Braxten completed yearly maintenance of our system). Trane heatpump has actually worked effectively and is so effective that it considerably decreased our utility expenditures - the system will pay for itself in less than 5 years. The few times we require them for emergencies they reacted quickly and resolved the issue.<p>

<p>7 To test it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect next to the compressor and the primary panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature listed below the space temperature level, and after that change it ON. To prevent straining an ac system's compressor, wait a minimum of 5 minutes between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You need to hear the outside compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. If the fan isn't turning, look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this).<p>
