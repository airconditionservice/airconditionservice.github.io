Load computing is referred to as the Manual J estimation and need to be carried out by the HVAC contractor before offering an installation or unit cost for cooling. Move to another contractor if your contractor states they understand the size of air conditioning unit you need based on experience or on square video alone. As with determining the size of an unit needed based upon BTUs, identifying the appropriate size of unit for your home also depends upon the unit load-- just how much cold air it will lose by space.<p>

<p>Heaters are like automobiles. As they age, you can change one part just need another part changed or fixed next year. It doesn't take long to spend $500 simply to keep an old oil or gas furnace running. Heating systems incur the most breakdowns in the last 2 years of their lives.
