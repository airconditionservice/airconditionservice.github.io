<p>It is common to presume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, relatively stable over time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a structure as relatively the same physical material gradually. In fact, the true nature of buildings can be considered as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be described and understood as complex systems. Research using the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the built environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
