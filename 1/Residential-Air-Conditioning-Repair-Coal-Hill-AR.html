<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Discovered both inside and outside, particulate matter is a mixture of liquid beads and solid particles suspended in the air, such as dust, pollen, smoke, and soot. The particles themselves are various sizes, however the ones to be most worried about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller-- because they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outside PM, generated by building and construction, for example, or the burning of fossil fuels, participates in buildings via natural and mechanical ventilation. Indoors it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
