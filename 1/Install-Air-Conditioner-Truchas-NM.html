<p>If you believe a mold issue-- either due to the fact that of visible development or a moldy smell consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much good if it does not remove the mold. Mold begins with a wetness problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can keep and inspect. Dripping return ducts can also introduce wetness. Once again, if you think a mold issue, consider having a service company check the duct system for leakages.<p>
