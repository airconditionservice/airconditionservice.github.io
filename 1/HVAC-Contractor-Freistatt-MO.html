Carbon monoxide gas is a typical air pollutant arising from natural gas that gets away into your home without being burned off. Older houses might include asbestos and lead particles, which can be harming to the lungs when released into the air. In restrooms and cooking areas, mold and mildew can become an annoyance where wetness levels are typically higher than in the rest of your home.<p>
<p>Central air conditioners, typically described as central air" or split-system air conditioning", circulate cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and signs up (i.e., openings in the floorings, ceilings, or walls covered by grills) bring cooled air from the ac system to the home. This cooled air becomes warmer as it flows through the house; then it recedes to the central air conditioning conditioner through return ducts and registers. Find out how central air conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
