<p>Carbon monoxide (CO) is an odorless, colorless poisonous gas. Due to the fact that it is difficult to see, taste or smell, CO can kill you before you know it is in your house. At lower levels of exposure, CO triggers moderate impacts that are frequently incorrect for the flu. These signs consist of headaches, lightheadedness, queasiness, disorientation and tiredness. The results of CO direct exposure can vary considerably from person to person depending upon age, total health and the concentration and length of direct exposure.<p>
