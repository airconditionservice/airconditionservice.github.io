<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might think. Due to the fact that most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive flexible hose) rather of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to wear and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>
<p>Reality: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment typically lasts years, because it is safeguarded indoors. When it does need to be replaced, the expenditure is much less than putting in an entire brand-new geothermal system, because the loop or well is the most pricey to set up. New technical standards eliminate the problem of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it forever. In the past, some improperly sized systems did overcool the ground or get too hot in time, to the point that the system no longer had enough of a temperature level gradient to operate.<p>
