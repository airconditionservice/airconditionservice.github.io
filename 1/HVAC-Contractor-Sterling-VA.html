<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is often in the range of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), since heatpump end up being inefficient in more extreme cold. This is since ice forms on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system should momentarily switch back into the regular a/c mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to make up for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
