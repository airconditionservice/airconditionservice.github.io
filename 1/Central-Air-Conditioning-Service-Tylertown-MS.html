<p>The directions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfortable finishing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the brand-new circuit breaker and last connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrician. We recommend you do the same. When the wiring is complete, stimulate the system for a few minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable heats. Don't put the system into complete operation till the thin-set and grout have had time to properly solidify and treat-- usually 2 to 4 weeks. Then call the family together and play a game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm restroom flooring.<p>
