<h3>Outdoor Air Conditioner in Plumsteadville PA</h3>
<p>For a heated floor area less than 20 sq. ft., you might (in most cases) draw power from a nearby GFCI-protected outlet without overloading the circuit. (If the thermostat you purchase is currently GFCI protected like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad must be GFCI secured.) But a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can trigger overloads and annoyance circuit breaker trips. For our larger mat, we elected to set up a dedicated circuit with its own electrical wiring and circuit breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are available.<p>

The next step is to thaw your air conditioning equipment if you discovered that your conditioning filter needs changing. The simplest way to defrost your HVAC equipment is to leave the unit off for a few hours, with the blower fan running.<p>
