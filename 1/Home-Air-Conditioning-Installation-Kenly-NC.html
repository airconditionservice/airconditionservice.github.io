<h3>Advantages of Expert AC Repair in Kenly NC</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was great and on time. Josh was very clear and fast about his assessment, guaranteeing I comprehended what was looked out. My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go purchase a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So maybe a little high on price for this service, however the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>
