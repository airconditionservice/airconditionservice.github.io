<p>Radiant heating covers a variety of different heater, including electric heating systems and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heat systems operate on comparable principles. When it comes to a boiler, the system heats by dispersing hot water through a series of pipes set up in the sub-floor of each space. In the case of electric radiant heat systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating elements. As the hot water (or electricity) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the floor and into the space.<p>

<p>As you typically require to use a self-leveling compound on top of the electric underfloor heater, you need to factor in the time it takes for this to totally dry before the floor covering can be put in location - this is usually a day or two.
