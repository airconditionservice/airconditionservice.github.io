<p>Instead of incorporating to the ducts in your house, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head system that mounts on a wall. Since approximately 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC system may be lost to leaks in your ducts, a ductless unit has a built-in efficiency advantage. Since they do not require any brand-new ductwork to be installed, ductless heat pumps are great for additions. Because a system is set up in each space or area you wish to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature of each zone, which can conserve energy. Some mini-splits even have tenancy sensing units that automatically raise the temperature level in the space when you exist.<p>
