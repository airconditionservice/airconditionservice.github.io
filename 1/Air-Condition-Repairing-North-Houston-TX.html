<h3>AC Compressor Repair in North Houston TX</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never ever have heard of the $5000 rule but got ta offer whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one inside your home and never requires maintenance and one outdoors and requires yearly and even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of purchase something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are just crazy and all over the location and I guess they know they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>

<p>Since my furnace was not working, I called Snowflake Air. Jose and his assistant showed up on time. Jose hung around repairing the issue, all the while explaining whatever to me. After discovering the thermostat was not working correctly. He needed to go get the correct replacement. After the installation of the brand-new thermostat, Jose discussed the operation and programing to me. I will definitely utilize Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
