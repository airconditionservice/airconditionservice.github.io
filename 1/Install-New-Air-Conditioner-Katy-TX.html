<p>Air conditioning system producers typically make rugged, high quality items. If your air conditioning system fails, start by checking any merges or circuit breakers. Let the unit cool off for about 5 minutes prior to resetting any breakers. If a central air conditioner's compressor stops on a hot day, the high-pressure limit switch might have tripped; reset it by pushing the button, located in the compressor's access panel.<p>
