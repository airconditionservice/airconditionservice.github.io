<h3>AC Unit Repair in Napavine WA</h3>
<p>Wow - just wow. I never ever have actually heard of the $5000 rule but got ta provide whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one indoors and never ever requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs annual or perhaps bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outside furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than purchase something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just crazy and all over the place and I think they know they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>

<p>A geothermal HVAC is not the same as geothermal energy though, and the two should not be puzzled. Where a geothermal HVAC taps into the heat inside the earth for area heating, cooling or for heating one's water supply, geothermal energy is the process by which the heat inside the earth is utilized for generating power in the type of electricity. The 2 operations utilize different processes, with geothermal energy requiring water be heated to boiling point to attain its objectives.<p>
