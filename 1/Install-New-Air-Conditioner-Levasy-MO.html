<h3>The Way to Receive Your HVAC Certification and HVAC Licensing at Levasy MO</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Loan and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a federal government firm, carried out a research study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it lowers energy costs by improving airflow. After testing 33 houses in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the research study found that there was no significant enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance air flow or energy efficiency. Sometimes, measured particle levels actually increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased instantly after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
