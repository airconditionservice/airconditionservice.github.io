<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company because the two service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
