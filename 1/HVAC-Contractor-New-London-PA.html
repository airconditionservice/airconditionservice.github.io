The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number showing the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The mix most utilized in direct-expansion house and building comfort cooling is an HCFC referred to as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>
