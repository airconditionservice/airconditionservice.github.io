<p>Radiant heat covers a range of different heater, including electric heating units and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heating systems run on similar concepts. When it comes to a boiler, the system heats up by distributing warm water through a series of pipelines installed in the sub-floor of each space.

As the warm water (or electrical energy) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the floor and into the space.<p>

<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, check these 3 things first. Make sure all the signs up in your home are broad open. Then make certain the furnace filter is tidy Then go outdoors and clean off the condenser coils (Photo 2). The decreased airflow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if numerous registers were closed or the filter was blocked. If you have actually altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or until there's good airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually resolved the problem.<p>
