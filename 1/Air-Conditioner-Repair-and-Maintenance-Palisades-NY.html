<p>If you presume a mold issue-- either since of visible development or a musty odor consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much excellent if it does not remove the mold. Mold begins with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can examine and maintain. Leaky return ducts can also present wetness. Once again, if you believe a mold problem, think about having a service company examine the duct system for leakages.<p>
<p>Some health effects might show up quickly after a single direct exposure or repeated direct exposures to a toxin. These consist of irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, lightheadedness, and fatigue. Such immediate effects are usually short-term and treatable. In some cases the treatment is merely removing the individual's direct exposure to the source of the pollution, if it can be identified. Not long after direct exposure to some indoor air toxins, signs of some diseases such as asthma may show up, be exacerbated or intensified.<p>

<p>When the heatpump headed out in our workplaces, Taylor at Stability was extremely useful in gathering info on the phone and supplying clear directions about how to momentarily handle the issue and prepare the heat pump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was incredibly effective and provided clear interaction about the problem, its remedies, and its future avoidance. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd prepared for, and the service was professional and friendly. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will definitely utilize Stability Energy Systems once again, for workplace and house.<p>
