<h3>Heat Pumps: What Are They And How Do They Function in Suwanee GA?</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon hot water heater. It went fantastic. Dealing with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 various water heaters. 2 on demand tankless and one high efficiency tank. The team took the entire day as they needed to get rid of the old water heater and set up all brand-new venting, gas lines for the new high efficiency heating unit. We selected getting something more expensive than a conventional hot water heater as gas is one of our biggest energy costs. We feel that this new system will last a long time and use very little energy to heat water.<p>

No additional charge.<p>

<h3>Furnace Cost in Suwanee GA</h3>
<p>I have been utilizing them for years for my services, my own houses and my realty customers' houses. I went through five other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies estimated me with various prices and different problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th person, who discussed to me thoroughly the concerns which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental house, another event. When I called and he encouraged me to contact service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the system working once again, he helped me problem shoot the issue. He is honest, trusted, and affordable on cost. It's hard to discover an honest AC guy and I'm happy I found Luis. Extremely recommend Luis and his company.<p>
