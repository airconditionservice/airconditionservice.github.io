<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company since the 2 specialists I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
