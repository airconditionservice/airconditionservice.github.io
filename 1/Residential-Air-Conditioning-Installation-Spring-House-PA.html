<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to end up. I 'd evaluated brand-new systems and installation for months. When I chose to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Load unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not only was the rate terrific but Mark went out of his method to tailor a couple of things in my house to make the overall air circulation more optimized. I think it actually just took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my system set up. I believe any future service related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
