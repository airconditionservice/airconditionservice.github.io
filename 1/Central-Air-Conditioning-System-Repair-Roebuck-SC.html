<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>The function of the majority of building ventilation systems is to generate adequate fresh air for resident comfort while controlling temperature, humidity, and indoor air quality for workers and developing safety at sensible energy expenses. Your furnace has many parts that can impact the health and safety of you and your loved ones. Having a total check of your furnace will provide assurance that it is safe to run. Paragon Heating & Home Comfort Solutions Combustion Optimization & Safety Inspection of your furnace consists of a Health & Safety Analysis, which inspects the heat exchanger (carbon monoxide leakages and infected breathing air), checks the pilot security (explosion danger), checks the high limit (fire threat) and consists of a visual assessment for other hazards. In truth, our Security Examination includes ten separate security checks of your system.<p>
<p>Air ducts are accountable for distributing cold and hot air throughout your home, offering a comfortable environment in every space.

<p>IAQ can be affected by gases (including carbon monoxide gas, radon, unstable organic substances ), particulates, microbial pollutants (mold, bacteria ), or any mass or energy stress factor that can cause negative health conditions.

Residential systems can further improve indoor air quality by regular cleaning of carpets and rug.<p>

Airborne aspects from regular home products and surfaces can cause formicary corrosion within your HVAC equipment. Left uncontrolled, these issues can lead to loss of effectiveness and even worse, breakdown of part materials and a shorter furnace life-span Over time, important parts like the heat exchanger, burners or blower real estate can start wearing away, causing lowered efficiency.<p>
