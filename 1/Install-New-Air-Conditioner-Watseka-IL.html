<p>Heating is the biggest energy expense in the typical house. In very dry climates, evaporative coolers, in some cases referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness throughout hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the inbound air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is decreased. The temperature level of the inbound air is lowered, but it is also more humid, so the overall heat (reasonable heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. Some of the sensible heat of the entering air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the entering air is dry enough, the outcomes can be quite substantial.<p>

When the furnace kicks in and that abrupt shot of coolness when it shuts off, gone is that rush of hot air.<p>
