<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â A lot of heating systems have numerous control panel. The biggest, or just one in some heaters, is often called the Motherboard. The circuit boards manage and coordinate the operation of the motors, sensors, ignitor, gas valve and more. DIY repair is possible, but the brand-new control panel need to be set up exactly right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work.
