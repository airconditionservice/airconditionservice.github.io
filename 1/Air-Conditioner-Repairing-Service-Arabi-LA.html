By selecting a central AC system that has as high of an effectiveness score as possible, you can lower your carbon footprint and save money in the long run.

<p>Biological contaminants consist of bacteria, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and feline saliva, house dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these toxins. Pollens originate from plants; viruses are transmitted by people and animals; germs are carried by individuals, animals, and soil and plant particles; and family animals are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a potent allergen. When it dries, it can end up being air-borne. Infected central air handling systems can become reproducing grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then distribute these impurities through the house.<p>
