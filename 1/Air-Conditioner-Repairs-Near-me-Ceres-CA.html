<p>Fantastic service within 24 hours and a fair price. The technician (Camryn) was very comprehensive and on-time in describing what services would be carried out. Also Camryn offered great customer service at the end of the consultation by explaining precisely what he had done, the condition of our heat pump, furnace and tankless hot water heater. He made a couple of ideas of some maintenance tasks we might wish to have performed in the future, but without the high pressure up-sale tactics employed by some in the market.<p>
<p>A 3rd way to decide whether your home might have poor indoor air quality is to look at your lifestyle and activities. Human activities can be considerable sources of indoor air contamination. Finally, search for signs of problems with the ventilation in your house. Indications that can show your house may not have sufficient ventilation consist of wetness condensation on walls or windows, stinky or stuffy air, filthy central heating and air cooling devices, and locations where books, shoes, or other products end up being musty. To identify smells in your home, step outside for a couple of minutes, and after that upon reentering your house, note whether smells are noticeable.<p>
<p>Indoor pollution sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the main cause of indoor air quality issues. Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor pollutant levels by not bringing in adequate outside air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air toxins out of the area. High temperature and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some pollutants.<p>
