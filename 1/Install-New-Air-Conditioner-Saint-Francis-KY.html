<p>Heating is the largest energy expense in the average house. In very dry climates, evaporative coolers, in some cases described as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness throughout hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the inbound air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is decreased. The temperature of the incoming air is lowered, however it is also more humid, so the overall heat (sensible heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. A few of the reasonable heat of the getting in air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The outcomes can be rather substantial if the getting in air is dry enough.<p>
<p>Whether you have central air, a ductless system, or a heatpump, everything requires to be replaced eventually. As devices ages, it becomes less efficient. Central air systems and heat pumps usually last about 10-15 years. Ductless split systems can last up to 20 years. If your system is near, or past, its expected life expectancy, replacement may be the most cost-efficient option.<p>

<p>To start with, The after hours responding to service agent, John, was really polite and professional. Secondly, Gracion W is a prompt, knowledgeable technician.

<p>Recent Evaluation: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was polite and well-informed. I was charged a fair price.
