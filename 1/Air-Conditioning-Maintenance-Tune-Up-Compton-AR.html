<h3>HVAC repair services in Compton AR</h3>
<p>Central air systems are determined in heaps. This measurement is based on the unit's ability to cool your home. For example, a 1 ton system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 increase in loads, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This means a 4.5 heap unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't familiar with the term BTU, it suggests the quantity of energy needed to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F Â°.<p>
<p>A/c can also be supplied by a process called free cooling which uses pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added because the temperature of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, therefore declining its effectiveness.<p>
<p>The cost for heat pump installation also depends on the size of the unit and whether it is a single-room or whole-home system. A single-room air-to-air system can cost as low as $500, consisting of installation. Whole-house systems, on the other hand, variety in price from $2,500 to $7,500, consisting of installation. Geothermal heat pumps generally require excavation to set up, which adds numerous thousand dollars to the cost.<p>
