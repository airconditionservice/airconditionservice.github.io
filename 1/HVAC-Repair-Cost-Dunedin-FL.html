<p>Immediate discount rates on high-efficiency heatpump technologies are offered to equipment installers, used at the wholesaler or supplier point-of-purchase. Outstanding Client Service! Climate Pro is trustworthy and genuinely cared about us and our circumstance. We came home one night to a cold house. I called Environment Pro, and Warren came over that very same night. Although he didn't have actually the needed replacement part in his van, he changed his schedule so he might try to find and buy it the next early morning. Less than 24 hours after I called him, I was absolutely glad to have a heated house again. What's most remarkable was that this all occurred during Thanksgiving week! I wasn't sure we 'd discover someone to assist us right before a vacation, however Climate Pro came through for us. I will happily advise this company to my good friends.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to complete. I 'd evaluated new systems and installation for months. When I decided to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Lot unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not just was the price excellent but Mark went out of his way to personalize a few things in my home to make the total air flow more optimized. I think it actually only took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future business associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
