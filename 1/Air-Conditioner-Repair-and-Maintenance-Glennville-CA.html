<p>Under-timber piping is where hydronic piping is set within a wood flooring joist system, below the wooded subsurface and last floor finish. This is normally utilized in a second or third-floor  location and makes the most of the flooring joist cavities while preventing the cost, weight and additional thickness of an in-screed concrete put. To make an under-timber glowing floor heat hydronic system efficient, the joist areas are insulated with fiberglass batts, and foil reflectors are set up under the pipes to direct heat upward.<p>
<p>Installation involves digging deep holes or long trenches to install the pipelines, so it's labor-intensive on the front end.
