<h3>Air Conditioner Servicing in Bardstown KY</h3>
<p>The Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a government agency, conducted a study in the 1990s to examine two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it lowers energy costs by improving air flow. After evaluating 33 houses in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the research study found that there was no significant enhancement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy performance. Sometimes, measured particle levels actually increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced right away after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is usually an absence of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without airflow, wetness from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC unit, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and try again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
