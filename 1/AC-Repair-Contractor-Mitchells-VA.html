<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Effectiveness (97%) Phoenix Light Responsibility 50 gallon hot water heater. It went great. Dealing with Braxten was a satisfaction. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. 2 on demand tankless and one high performance tank. The crew took the whole day as they needed to get rid of the old hot water heater and install all new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high performance heating system. We selected getting something more pricey than a conventional hot water heater as gas is one of our greatest energy costs.

Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or until there's excellent air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to check it.

<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly used in dry cleaning. In lab research studies, it has actually been revealed to trigger cancer in animals.
