<p>Watch out for indications of water leaks or flooding to stop mold from growing. Porous products, ceiling, floor, and wall coverings, and furniture discovered in the basements that have actually been damp for over 24 to 48 hours may become a source for mold development and should be discarded. Often there is a moldy smell but mold can not be seen. Mold does not require light to grow and can grow in surprise or seldom accessed areas of your house, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a range of surfaces: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on floor covering products including carpet underpadding. If a source of water or condensation can be found, opportunities exist will be mold growing nearby. Repair the moisture problem, either by locating the leakage or water source or by dehumidifying the area. Thoroughly tidy the location using established health department suggestions.<p>
