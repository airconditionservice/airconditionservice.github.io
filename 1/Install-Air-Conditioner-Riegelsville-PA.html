<p>My house has 5 systems, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" discovered something wrong with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned for an additional $30.00. (He actually stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I got a refund and complained) When this person belittled me for my "not understanding", I tossed him off the residential or commercial property.<p>
<p>The EPA and CMHC scientists utilized different methodologies. The CMHC study called on several duct-cleaning services.

While the duct-cleaning market argues both studies have flaws, no other research study has challenged the findings. And although the devices and techniques used by duct-cleaning companies have actually changed because these research studies were performed, the duct in homes haven't.<p>
