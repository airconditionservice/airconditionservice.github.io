<p>Current Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
