<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Disease is triggered by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The primary path of exposure is through the creation of an aerosol effect, most typically from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A common source of Legionella in commercial structures is from badly put or preserved evaporative cooling towers, which frequently launch water in an aerosol which may get in neighboring ventilation consumption. Break outs in medical facilities and nursing homes, where patients are immuno-suppressed and immuno-weak, are the most frequently reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has involved outside water fountains in public attractions. The presence of Legionella in commercial building water products is highly under-reported, as healthy people need heavy exposure to obtain infection.<p>
