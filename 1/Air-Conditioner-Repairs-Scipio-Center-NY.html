<p>Circuit Board Replacement: Ã¢ $ " Ã The majority of furnaces have numerous control panel. The biggest, or only one in some heating systems, is in some cases called the Motherboard. The circuit boards coordinate the operation and control of the motors, sensing units, ignitor, gas valve and more.
