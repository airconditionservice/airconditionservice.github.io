According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air contaminants are typically 2 to 5 times greater than outside levels, and in many cases these levels can go beyond 100 times that of outdoor levels of the same pollutants. Simply put, often the air inside can be more hazardous than the air exterior.<p>
