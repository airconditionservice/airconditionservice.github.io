<p>Appropriate ventilation helps enhance indoor air quality. It's simple to believe that the air quality outside is even worse than the air quality inside. We understand about air pollution and acid rain, we can see smoke and smell exhaust, and we might even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck spew thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air contaminants are typically 2 to 5 times greater than outside levels, and in many cases these levels can go beyond 100 times that of outdoor levels of the same pollutants. Simply put, often the air inside can be more hazardous than the air exterior.<p>
