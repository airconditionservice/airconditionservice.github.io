<p>It is common to assume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, fairly steady in time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a building as relatively unchanged physical product gradually. In fact, the real nature of buildings can be deemed the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be described and comprehended as complicated systems. Research applying the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment thinking about the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
