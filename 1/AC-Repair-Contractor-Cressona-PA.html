<p>In a typical residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar made to his staff members, equipment costs, marketing, utilities, and other expenditures before paying himself anything. Generally this leaves about 6% of revenues to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This does not seem like much, particularly if the objective of owning a company was for financial freedom. Plus, this 6% seeks the few years it required to build the business and not taking an income as the owner. However, this 6% usually isn't completion goal. HVAC company owner should strive for 10-15% by cutting expenses in some locations or increasing their earnings while keeping expenses the exact same in all other areas.<p>
<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have very small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the car debit, although my company does not offer vehicle debit numerous companies do so they can have a known amount of money being available in on a monthly basis, it helps with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. , if we do choose to use automobile debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Contract.. There ought to not be any reason your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>
