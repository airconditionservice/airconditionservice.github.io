<h3>Things to Look for When Selecting an Eden Prairie MN HVAC Professional</h3>
<p>You are a covidiot if you require furnace work in West Seattle and do not user James Heating. Our furnace went down with a damaged igniter, and nobody else could come other than for SW. They came and stated it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the job, but they needed to purchase it. My better half stated that she had seen a terrific review for James, so I called. He came in a couple of hours (weaving a mask) and described the scenario to me. He said it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 overall. He offered to come back today, however I moved it to tomorrow. James is one of the best, most decent people I have met in a long period of time. We need to support the real people who are there for us if we want to have alternatives to ACME heating. Please do.<p>
