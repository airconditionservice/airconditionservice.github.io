<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider since the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
