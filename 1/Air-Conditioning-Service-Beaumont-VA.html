Other radiators are still used, such as wall-mounted panels or baseboard heating units-- although ceiling radiators are generally utilized in commercial applications like storage facilities.<p>
<p>When the heat pump went out in our offices, Taylor at Stability was extremely valuable in collecting info on the phone and providing clear directions about how to briefly cope with the problem and prepare the heatpump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was remarkably effective and offered clear communication about the issue, its solutions, and its future prevention. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was friendly and expert. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will absolutely utilize Stability Energy Systems again, for workplace and home.<p>
