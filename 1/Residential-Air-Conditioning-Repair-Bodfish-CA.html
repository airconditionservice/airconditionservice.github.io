As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is activated, and the air conditioning unit has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The a/c's power consumption will increase by 50 W to make up for this, thus making the 100 W heating component cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
