<p>Structures are created or planned to react actively to some of these changes around them with heating, cooling, ventilating, air cleaning or illuminating systems. We clean, sanitize, and preserve surfaces to enhance their performance, longevity, or appearance. In other cases, such modifications discreetly or perhaps dramatically change buildings in ways that may be necessary to their own integrity or their impact on structure occupants through the development of the physical, chemical, and biological processes that define them at any time. We might discover it beneficial to integrate the tools of the physical sciences with those of the life sciences and, specifically, a few of the methods used by scientists studying ecosystems, in order to gain an enhanced understanding of the environments in which we invest the majority of our time, our structures.<p>
