<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company since the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>All modern air conditioning systems, even little window plan units, are equipped with internal air filters. These are usually of a lightweight gauze-like material, and need to be replaced or washed as conditions warrant. For example, a building in a high dust environment, or a home with furry pets, will need to have the filters changed more often than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as required will add to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in lost energy, shortened devices life, and higher energy costs; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air circulation. In addition, extremely unclean or plugged filters can cause overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
