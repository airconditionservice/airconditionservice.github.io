<p>An automobile's coolant system transfers excess heat from one part of the engine and finally loses it through the radiator fins. With time, the coolant ends up being filthy and old. The old coolant will negatively affect the system's performance. To make certain the system is working effectively, consider having a routine coolant system flush. A coolant flush is basic maintenance for your vehicle's cooling system. Call 206-523-2133 or visit Acme Automobile Electric & Repair in Seattle, WA 98103 for all your coolant system flush and fill requirements.<p>
<p>Air contaminants can vary from impurities generated from the outdoors by your pets to hazardous gas leakages. Carbon monoxide is a typical air pollutant resulting from natural gas that gets away into your house without being burned off. Older houses may consist of asbestos and lead particles, which can be damaging to the lungs when launched into the air. In kitchen areas and restrooms, mold and mildew can become an annoyance where moisture levels are generally higher than in the rest of your home.<p>
<p>The primary health effect connected with direct exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels might pose threats, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air consisting of radon. Major health companies (like the Centers for Illness Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number might range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. If you smoke and your house has high radon levels, your threat of lung cancer is specifically high.<p>
