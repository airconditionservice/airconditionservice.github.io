<p>It is common to assume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively steady over time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a structure as relatively the same physical product gradually. In reality, the real nature of buildings can be viewed as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be explained and comprehended as complicated systems. Research applying the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the developed environment thinking about the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
