<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole living space. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning aid determine the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes result from a combination of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate moisture, Air cleaning takes place. The goal is to offer adequate changes to ensure a healthy environment. There are a number of types of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be set up to accomplish this. A common aspect necessary in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side illustration in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies assistance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Style.<p>
