My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go purchase a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So possibly a little steep on rate for this service, however the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>

<h3>Heating And Air Conditioning Service in Bay Village OH</h3>
<p>I typically don't leave evaluations however wanted to share my experience. You don't anticipate having to replace your AC unit. Regrettably for us, we had no other choice. What made me go with this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert going over my options. After business hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and talk about options. I arranged my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their method. We were referred by a family pal and now I will suggest this company to my good friends.<p>
<p>Plan on investing several thousand dollars for the complete system if you are thinking about setting up a central heating and air-conditioning system when you don't have one in your home.
