<p>It is common to presume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable with time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a building as fairly unchanged physical material over time. In reality, the true nature of structures can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be described and understood as intricate systems. Research study using the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the built environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
