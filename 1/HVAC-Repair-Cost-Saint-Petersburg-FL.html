<p>AC systems and thermostats have integrated hold-up features when they're closed down and then repowered. The hold-up can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you've signed up for an energy-saving gadget from your local power energy, the system can take even longer to reset. If you've installed the parts shown and re-installed the disconnect block, repowered the circuit breaker, switched on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and lowered the temperature below the indoor temperature, and the system does not fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>

<p>The predominant health impact connected with exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels may posture risks, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Major health companies (like the Centers for Disease Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes countless avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number could range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. Your threat of lung cancer is particularly high if you smoke and your home has high radon levels.<p>
