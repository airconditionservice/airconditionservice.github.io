<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may believe. Since the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, affordable flexible pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand well to wear and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
