Another system needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned for an extra $30.00. (He actually stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I complained and got a refund) When this guy belittled me for my "not understanding", I tossed him off the residential or commercial property.<p>

<p>At present, EPA does not advise using air cleaners to lower levels of radon and its decay items. The effectiveness of these devices is uncertain since they just partially get rid of the radon decay products and do not decrease the amount of radon getting in the house. EPA prepares to do additional research study on whether air cleaners are, or could end up being, a reliable means of lowering the health threat from radon. EPA's pamphlet, Residential Air-Cleaning Gadgets, offers additional details on air-cleaning devices to reduce indoor air contaminants.<p>
