<h3>Air Conditioner Servicing in Newport Beach CA</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Task 50 gallon water heater. It went terrific. Dealing with Braxten was a satisfaction. We got a quote for 3 various water heaters. 2 as needed tankless and one high efficiency tank. The crew took the whole day as they needed to get rid of the old water heater and set up all brand-new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high efficiency heating unit. We selected getting something more expensive than a standard water heater as gas is among our greatest energy expenditures. We feel that this new unit will last a very long time and use very little energy to heat water.<p>

Simply put, in-floor heating systems supply a different mode and level of comfort. And, as various public awareness projects have long advised us, the more comfortable we feel, the more inclined we might be to push down our thermostat, in turn decreasing our energy expenditures.<p>
