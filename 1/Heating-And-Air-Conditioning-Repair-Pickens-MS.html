<p>A clogged furnace filter can trigger a furnace to shut off. Unclean filters are the most common cause of furnace problems. Dust and dirt limit airflow-- and if the filter gets too clogged up, the heat exchanger will get too hot and shut off too quickly, and your house will not warm up. If the blower is running however no heat is coming out, change the filter. An unclean filter likewise triggers soot buildup on the heat exchanger, minimizing the efficiency of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>

<p>There are some ranges of mold which contain poisonous substances (mycotoxins). Nevertheless, direct exposure to harmful levels of mycotoxin by means of inhalation is not possible in many cases, as toxins are produced by the fungal body and are not at substantial levels in the released spores. The main hazard of mold growth, as it relates to indoor air quality, originates from the allergenic properties of the spore cell wall. More severe than many allergenic properties is the capability of mold to trigger episodes in persons that already have asthma, a severe respiratory disease.<p>
<p>There is a required balance in making your decision though as systems with greater AFUE scores typically include greater price. So, make sure to choose based upon how typically you will use your heater, the load that will be placed on it and the frequency with which you intend on having it serviced each year. For the majority of temperate environments with low heating loads in the winter, having a very high rated heater is not constantly required.<p>
<p>Since heating & cooling work might also require installing or repairing pipes to supply oil or gas to heating devices, an HVAC contractor may also be needed to hold a separate plumbing professional's license or have a licensed plumbing technician on call. Nevertheless, some jurisdictions license HVAC contractors particularly for this kind of work. When getting a quote, make sure to ask not just if a company is accredited, however likewise what kind of license it holds.<p>
