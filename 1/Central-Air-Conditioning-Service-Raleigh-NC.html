<h3>Natural Gas Furnace Service in Raleigh NC</h3>
<p>I have actually been utilizing them for years for my companies, my own homes and my realty clients' homes. I went through 5 other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All five other companies quoted me with different prices and various issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth individual, who explained to me completely the problems which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental home, another occasion. When I called and he encouraged me to call warranty which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the unit working once again, he assisted me trouble shoot the concern. He is truthful, dependable, and sensible on cost. It's difficult to discover a sincere AC guy and I'm pleased I discovered Luis. Extremely recommend Luis and his company.<p>
<p>Ron, the owner, connected to me regarding an unusually high expense that I got blindsided by BEFORE he knew that I had called the service manager and left a message of concern. Ron had spotted the problem area in looking over the costs. He solved the issue in one day, had adjusted the costs to what I thought about reasonable prior to he called back, knew what may have triggered the issue and had a strategy to guarantee that it would not take place again. I have thought about All Points a company with stability for the nine years we have utilized them. This experience confirms that.<p>
<p>Mobile homes are usually smaller than stick-built residential or commercial properties and use substantially less oil and a much smaller sized furnace to heat. Expect the typical mobile house oil furnace to have beginning costs of around $1,500. Bear in mind that not as many brand names produce oil heating systems for this use, and you may discover more options with natural gas, gas, or electric heaters.<p>
<p>What do you do when the company that's providing the service contract tries to upsell you each time they concern carry out routine maintenance? If the coils were cleaned in March 2015, why would they be showing "extreme rust" in June 2015 and need a deep cleaning for $400? They offered her a Reme Halo for $1,300, giving her a 10% discount if she renewed her PMA for seven years, although it was 6 months prior to the current one ended. She didn't require a air purification system, but they talked her into it.<p>
