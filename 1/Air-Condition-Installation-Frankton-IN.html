<p>Sean was extremely handy. He is an extremely pleasant person to deal with. No pressure used to buy extra things. Addressed all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He was able to put rise protectors on the system and do the full maintenance on the unit. that was to make certain they were no issues besides the blower motor. Because there was not one on hand, the only factor he might not install the new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he knows for sure what the concern is.<p>
<p>7 To test it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the detach beside the compressor and the primary panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature below the room temperature level, and after that change it ON. To prevent straining an air conditioning system's compressor, wait a minimum of five minutes between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You need to hear the outdoor compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. Look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this) if the fan isn't turning.<p>
