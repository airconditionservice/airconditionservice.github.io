Failure to replace these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat currency exchange rate, leading to squandered energy, reduced equipment life, and higher energy expenses; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air flow. Additionally, extremely unclean or plugged filters can cause overheating during a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system and even fire.<p>
<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Simply take a picture of the wires before disconnecting anything (you may need a referral in the future).

The female crimp ports should snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. If it's not, get rid of the adapter and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you've switched all the wires, protect the brand-new capacitor (Photo 5).<p>
