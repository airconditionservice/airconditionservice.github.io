<p>All homes need efficient ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more typical than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot burner has actually been burnt out from usage. Another possible reason could be a broken thermostat, preventing the furnace from adapting to the right temperature. Heaters that kick on often might be because of a dirty filter, which is not permitting the furnace to cycle air properly. If your furnace is making a great deal of racket when it turns on or is humming, there may be an internal problem. While humming is triggered by a slipped belt in the internal workings, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled or perhaps a dirty burner.<p>
