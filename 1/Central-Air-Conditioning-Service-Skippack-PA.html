<p>Heating is the largest energy expense in the typical home. In very dry climates, evaporative coolers, often referred to as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during heat. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a damp pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature level of the inbound air is reduced, but it is likewise more damp, so the overall heat (practical heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. Some of the reasonable heat of the getting in air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. If the entering air is dry enough, the outcomes can be rather significant.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding job finding the outdoor unit as near your house as possible per my request. The job took 2 days and my yard and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was really knowledgeable of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed up until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
