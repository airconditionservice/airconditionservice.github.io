<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might believe. Due to the fact that many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a little, economical flexible pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to use and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>

The sound level is itâ and low $ s terrific on energy conserving too.<p>
