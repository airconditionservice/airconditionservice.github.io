<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company because the two specialists I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>PE companies tend to run with the goal of selling or spinning off a firm eventually. This could be through a public offering, a sale to a large organisation in the field, or perhaps a sale to another PE company. CoolSys is an HVAC contractor owned by PE company Ares Management. Ares bought CoolSys from Audex, another PE company, previously this year. Audex had owned CoolSys for three years before that.<p>
<p>I called Snowflake Air due to the fact that my furnace was not working. Jose and his assistant got here on time. Jose hung around fixing the problem, all the while describing everything to me. After discovering the thermostat was not working properly. He had to go get the appropriate replacement. After the installation of the new thermostat, Jose explained the operation and programing to me. I will definitely utilize Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
