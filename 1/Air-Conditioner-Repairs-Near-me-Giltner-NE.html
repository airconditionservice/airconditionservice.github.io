<p>When setting up over concrete slabs, we suggest using our insulation boards. Warmup Insulation Boards will conserve you money when utilized in combination with underfloor heating by serving as an extremely effective thermal barrier. They shows the heat upwards into the flooring tile instead of permitting heat to heat up the concrete slab below. By using Warmup Insulation Boards you will discover that after switching on your heating, your floor tiles will warm up in about 10-15 minutes.
