<p>A clogged furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut off. Filthy filters are the most common reason for furnace issues. Dust and dirt restrict airflow-- and if the filter gets too clogged, the heat exchanger will shut and get too hot off too quickly, and your home will not warm up. Change the filter if the blower is running however no heat is coming out. An unclean filter also triggers soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, minimizing the performance of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>
<h3>Residential HVAC in Croydon UT</h3>
<p>If your a/c is more than 8 years old, repair is most likely not worth the cost, unless it's an easy problem like debris obstructing the condenser unit or a worn fan belt. Still, to best weigh your repair-or-replace decision, ask your contractor to assess not simply the condition of your existing equipment, but also the ducts that deliver the cool air and the overall quality of the insulation in your house. Improving those components may increase the efficiency of the system as much or more than setting up brand-new machinery.<p>

New ductwork installation can add an additional cost anywhere from $1,200 to $4,200 depending on the level of complexity to set up or change. Plan to include a few days of labor to your HVAC replacement project if you do require ductwork replacement.<p>
