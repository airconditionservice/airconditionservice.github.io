<p>Indoor air contamination is caused by burning strong fuel sources - such as fire wood, crop waste, and dung - for cooking and heating. Natural gas. is used in countless houses worldwide.

<p>A split a/c consists of 2 main parts - a compressor situated outside and a within air outlet unit.

<h3>Knowing the Essentials of Furnace, AC and HVAC Maintenance at Birdseye IN</h3>
<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is connected to a remote condenser unit utilizing refrigerant piping in between a outdoor and indoor unit instead of ducting air directly from the outside system. Indoor units with directional vents mount onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or suit the ceiling. Other indoor units mount inside the ceiling cavity, so that short lengths of duct deal with air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the spaces.<p>
