<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to complete. I 'd priced out new units and installation for months. Once I decided to last progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Load system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not just was the cost terrific however Mark headed out of his method to customize a few things in my house to make the total air circulation more optimized.
