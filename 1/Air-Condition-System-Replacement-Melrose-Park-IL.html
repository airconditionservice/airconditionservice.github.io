<p>The majority of central air conditioning conditioners are connected to a home's forced-air distribution system. Therefore, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are used to distribute cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is running, hot air inside your house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your home. When the air conditioning system works but your home doesn't cool, the problem is most likely in the circulation system.<p>
