<p>Co2 concentrations increase as an outcome of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the buildup of co2 to quasi "consistent state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. Therefore, measurements of carbon dioxide for functions of assessing the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged duration of constant occupancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in workplaces a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable indication of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to measure carbon dioxide ought to be calibrated often, and outside measurements used for computations need to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature impacts on measurements made outdoors may likewise be needed.<p>
<p>Inadequate maintenance of the HVAC system likewise may contribute to indoor air quality problems. Ventilation system filters that are not replaced regularly may become clogged, reducing air circulation quality, distribution, and volume. They also might end up being locations for germs and molds to be and grow distributed throughout the home. Humidifier systems on HVAC systems also should be appropriately preserved to avoid bacteria and mold contamination.<p>

Railways are another high-wage employer, at approximately $29.33 per hour or $61,000 annually.<p>
