<h3>Repair and Maintenance for Fithian IL Commercial Air Conditioning</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon hot water heater. It went terrific. Dealing with Braxten was a satisfaction. We got a quote for 3 different hot water heater. Two as needed tankless and one high effectiveness tank. The crew took the entire day as they needed to get rid of the old water heater and set up all new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high efficiency heating unit. We selected getting something more costly than a traditional hot water heater as gas is among our greatest energy expenditures. We feel that this brand-new unit will last a very long time and use very little energy to heat water.<p>
<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most common blend used in autos in the U.S. up until 1994, when most styles altered to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting potential of R-12.

For systems needing just a periodic "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in excellent working order and carrying out far much better than virtually all "R-134a" systems whether "converted" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is thought about "cheap" by numerous people.<p>
