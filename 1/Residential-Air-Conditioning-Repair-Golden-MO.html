It doesn't take long to spend $500 simply to keep an old oil or natural gas furnace running. Furnaces sustain the most breakdowns in the last 2 years of their lives.

<p>Terrific Item! Shipment was sort of weird being that package was opened and products might have fell out. But after review of contents we assured it was all undamaged. The product was very lite weight and takes some time to use. Note: buy recommended non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as suggested to the height of the shower head and had to adjust the shower flooring and curb to fit. Be sure to watch the video first prior to installation and follow all instructions exactly. , if you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.. We had issues with air bubble pockets. After getting in touch with support, we solved issues. I would recommend this item to anyone who's redesigning or installing their restroom for the first time.
