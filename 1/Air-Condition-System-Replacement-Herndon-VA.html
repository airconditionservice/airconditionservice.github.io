<p>A/c can likewise be supplied by a process called free cooling which utilizes pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is included due to the fact that the temperature of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, thereby declining its efficiency.<p>
<p>Some biological impurities activate allergic reactions, including hypersensitivity pneumonitis, hay fever, and some types of asthma. Infectious illnesses, such as influenza, measles, and chicken pox are transmitted through the air. Mildews and molds launch disease-causing contaminants. Symptoms of health issue caused by biological contaminants include sneezing, watery eyes, coughing, shortness of breath, dizziness, sleepiness, fever, and digestive issues.<p>
<p>Indoor pollution sources that release gases or particles into the air are the main cause of indoor air quality issues. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor pollutant levels by not bringing in adequate outside air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air toxins out of the location. Heat and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some pollutants.<p>
