<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, fairly steady with time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a structure as relatively unchanged physical product with time.
