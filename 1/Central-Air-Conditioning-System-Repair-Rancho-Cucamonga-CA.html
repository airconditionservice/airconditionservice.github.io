<p>SysTech Design focuses on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for improving and preserving the quality of the air around a commercial environment. The exact same applies for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it distributes through your house. Condensed wetness can trigger dust and other particles to adhere to and build up on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils guarantees dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from building up on and beneath the coils, which can cause mold issues.<p>
<p>Whether you have central air conditioning, a ductless system, or a heatpump, whatever needs to be changed eventually. As equipment ages, it ends up being less effective. Central air conditioning systems and heat pumps normally last about 10-15 years. Ductless split systems can last up to twenty years. If your system is near, or past, its anticipated life expectancy, replacement might be the most cost-effective solution.<p>

<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider because the two service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>In homes, the most significant sources of formaldehyde are likely to be pressed wood items made using adhesives that contain urea-formaldehyde (UF) resins.

<p>Reality: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange devices generally lasts decades, because it is protected inside your home.
