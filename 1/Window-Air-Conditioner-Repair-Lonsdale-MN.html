<p>The directions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfortable finishing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the new breaker and last connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We recommend you do the very same. As soon as the electrical wiring is total, stimulate the system for a couple of minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable heats up.
