<h3>Turning to the Ideal Company for the Right Furnace Repair in Castleton VA</h3>
<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is linked to a remote condenser system using refrigerant piping between a outside and indoor unit instead of ducting air directly from the outdoor unit. Indoor systems with directional vents install onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or suit the ceiling. Other indoor units mount inside the ceiling cavity, so that short lengths of duct deal with air from the indoor system to vents or diffusers around the spaces.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and experienced. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
