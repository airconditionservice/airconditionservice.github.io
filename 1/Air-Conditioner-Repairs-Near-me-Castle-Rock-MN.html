<p>4 Seasons has actually set up both of my heating systems and air conditioners, cleaned up the ducts and done the yearly maintenance. I have found them to be fairly priced, timely and do fine work. When they installed my main furnace they went well beyond what was needed and redid the whole plenum and the duct work for the hot water heater because the service technicians believed they simply didn't appear ideal and they could not leave them that method. No additional charge.<p>
