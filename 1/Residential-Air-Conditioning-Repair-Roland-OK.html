<p>A packaged unit, usually set up on the roofing system, is most commonly used on commercial buildings, however it is also an alternative for house owners to consider. Many times, these units consist of not only the air conditioning unit itself but likewise a furnace. An advantage of this system is definitely the cost. Packaged systems are fantastic for those wanting to save cash on the installation of a brand-new heating & cooling system individually, considering that the unit is integrated. However, one con is that these systems are normally only offered for larger houses due to their high power and capability. Additionally, while they can be an excellent way to conserve cash on a total HVAC system, they're still substantially more costly than purchasing simply a cooling system. Therefore, this may not be the very best choice for property owners trying to find short-term savings or those with smaller sized budgets.<p>
