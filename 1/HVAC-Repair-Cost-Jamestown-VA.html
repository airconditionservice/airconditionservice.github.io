<p>Check these three things initially if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make sure all the registers in your home are broad open. Then be sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go outdoors and tidy off the condenser coils (Image 2). The decreased air flow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if a number of registers were closed or the filter was clogged. If you've altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the registers, deice the A-coil.

Then turn the AC back on to test it. You have actually solved the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
