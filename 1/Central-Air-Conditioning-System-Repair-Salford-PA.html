<p>In 2011, NASA was on the lookout for an air conditioning system to set up in their lunar electric rover. They decided they required specialist help and consulted numerous providers. Finally, after an extensive choice procedure, the area company selected Dometic. We've had a great deal of firsts over the years, however this custom task provided unique challenges for our engineers," stated a spokesperson for Dometic.

<p>Indoor temperature levels are sometimes more challenging to control than they appear due to factors such as heat gains from sunlight, outside conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE recommends temperatures ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summertime; indoor relative humidity needs to be preserved at or listed below 65%. The EPA advises humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to decrease mold growth.<p>
<p>Sometimes a temporary indoor air quality problem is developed merely by a one-off, out-of-the-ordinary activity taking place inside a space or building, such as an overcrowded conference location. In those cases, a short-term fix may be all that's needed, such as bringing or opening a window in a fan. But more intricate concerns-- identified by consistently inappropriate air quality tracking results-- will require a different tack. Depending on the concern you're experiencing, one of the three methods below may be appropriate.<p>
