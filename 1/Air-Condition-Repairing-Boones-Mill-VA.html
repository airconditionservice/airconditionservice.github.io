The outside system should likewise be located in an open area, otherwise the heat from the house will not be efficiently released outside and the performance of the entire system will drop greatly.

Lastly, look for indications of issues with the ventilation in your house. Signs that can suggest your home may not have adequate ventilation include moisture condensation on walls or windows, stuffy or smelly air, filthy central heating and air cooling equipment, and areas where books, shoes, or other items become moldy. To find smells in your home, action outside for a couple of minutes, and then upon reentering your house, note whether odors are noticeable.<p>
<p>Keep an eye out for indications of water leakages or flooding to stop mold from growing. Porous products, flooring, ceiling, and wall coverings, and furnishings discovered in the basements that have been damp for over 24 to two days might become a source for mold growth and must be disposed of. In some cases there is a musty odor but mold can not be seen. Mold does not require light to grow and can flourish in concealed or seldom accessed locations of your home, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a range of surface areas: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on flooring products consisting of carpet underpadding. If a source of water or condensation can be found, chances exist will be mold growing close by. Repair the moisture problem, either by finding the leak or water source or by dehumidifying the area. Thoroughly tidy the area using recognized health department recommendations.<p>
