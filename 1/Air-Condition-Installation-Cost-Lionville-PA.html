<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier since the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<h3>Heating Strategies For Gas Home Furnaces at Lionville PA</h3>
<p>Even newer heaters less than five years old have actually been discovered as bad. A lot of property owners are shocked to discover that their 'new' furnace has a cracked heat exchanger.

<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is typically a lack of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is brought on by a plugged filter.

If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, since something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
