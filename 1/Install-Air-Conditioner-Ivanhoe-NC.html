<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to end up. I 'd priced out brand-new units and installation for months. As soon as I decided to last progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Lot unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not just was the price great but Mark headed out of his way to customize a few things in my house to make the overall air circulation more enhanced. I think it literally just took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future service related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
