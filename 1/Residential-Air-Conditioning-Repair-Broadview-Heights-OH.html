Modern 2- and three-stage heaters increase performance even further by running at lower or higher capacity depending upon the heating requirements of the location.<p>
<p>For example, pollutants may collect within the air diffusers and grills, presenting toxins into the environment. Or if the outdoor air intake lies near a source of moisture or other outside pollutant, it may function as a pathway to carry the pollutants inside.
