<p>When business is less busy, it can be the ideal time to brainstorm imaginative approaches for promoting your HVAC company also. For example, you may attempt participating in house and garden shows, trade shows or other type of occasion marketing. Or possibly you'll present a contest, a free gift or a special funding plan to boost equipment sales. If the experiments settle, you can formalize them as part of the marketing strategy you outline in next year's company plan.<p>
<p>While these steps will help to keep your AC system in leading shape, understand that there are maintenance products that just an experienced HVAC technician will be able to do. For example, a slow refrigerant leakage in your AC system can lead to expensive compressor failure, however a house owner doesn't have the tools or abilities required to check refrigerant levels. Also, tidy ducts and proper air flow are important to a well-functioning system, however house owners do not have the necessary devices for the job. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a smart homeowner, it's still needed to have an expert technician check the system periodically.<p>
<p>With the cost of electrical energy and gas increasing, it is essential to have your furnace tuned-up for maximum energy cost savings.

<p>Indoor pollution sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the main reason for indoor air quality issues. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor pollutant levels by not generating enough outside air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air pollutants out of the location. Heat and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some toxins.<p>
