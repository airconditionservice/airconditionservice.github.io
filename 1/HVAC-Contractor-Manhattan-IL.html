Jamey Stephens of Evergreen Home Heating and Energy has seen the single-family home installation organisation completely flip on its head the last couple of years.

It's been a cultural shift," says Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the environment and individuals." And not simply with beginners more accustomed to AC living. Long time Seattle property owners are finally giving in, he says, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit houses with air-cooling systems.<p>
