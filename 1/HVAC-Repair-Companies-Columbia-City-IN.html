The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
