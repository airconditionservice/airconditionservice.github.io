We understand about air pollution and acid rain, we can see smoke and smell exhaust, and we may even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck gush thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air contaminants are typically 2 to 5 times higher than outdoor levels, and sometimes these levels can surpass 100 times that of outdoor levels of the exact same toxins. In other words, often the air inside can be more damaging than the air outside.<p>

<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, check these 3 things initially. Make certain all the signs up in your house are large open. Then be sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go outdoors and clean off the condenser coils (Photo 2). The decreased air flow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if numerous registers were closed or the filter was blocked. If you've changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or up until there's great airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've resolved the issue.<p>
