<p>Due to the current Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we want to help keep your house's Indoor Air Quality at its finest. The ability to cool and heat your home at maximum efficiency will depend a lot on how well insulated your home is presently and the size of your house. A 2500 square foot house will require a much bigger AC unit than a smaller home, which will affect installation costs. Likewise a house with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no cracks for air circulation will require far less AC capacity to keep temperature levels comfortable. Other aspects that can affect this might be the insulation somewhere else such as the foundation, roofing system, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>
<p>Geothermal HVAC systems are ending up being common features of environment-friendly homes as part of the growing green building movement.

By 2016, a Wall Street Journal post predicted that green real estate will grow from $36 billion a year to as much as $114 billion. That's approaching 30 to 40 percent of the entire real estate market.<p>

<h3>How to Get Your HVAC Certification and HVAC Licensing at Duncan SC</h3>
<p>Geothermal heat pumps are incredibly effective, because ground source heating is drawn out from depths where the temperature level is always at a continuous temperature. These systems can obtain a geothermal effectiveness of about 300 to 600 percent throughout the, Coldest winter nights; whereas air-source heat pumps can only obtain an efficiency of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter. Much like other types of heat pumps, ground source heatpump have their geothermal effectiveness rated according to their coefficient of efficiency (POLICE OFFICER). POLICE rates how much heat a system removes or produces (depending upon whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus how much the system uses to produce the heating or cooling impact. Most ground source heat pumps have COPs of about 3.0 to 5.0. What this means is that for every system of energy utilized by a geothermal heatpump, roughly 3 to 5 units are supplied back in the form of heat.<p>
