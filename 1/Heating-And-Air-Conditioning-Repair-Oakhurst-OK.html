<h3>The Advantages of Buying A New Furnace in Oakhurst OK</h3>
<p>Rates for furnace service and maintenance will vary widely from dealership to dealer, for a number of factors.

<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode".

This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the demand to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
