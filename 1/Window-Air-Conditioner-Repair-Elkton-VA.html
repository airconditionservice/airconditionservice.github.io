<h3>The Benefits of Routine HVAC Maintenance in Elkton VA</h3>
<p>Most people do not know how humidity is eliminated from your Houston Midtown Tx home. The evaporator HVAC coil in your attic also acts a dehumidifier. All the damp hot air that goes through your HVAC coil, condenses. That humidity is then removed from the area that is being cooled. You'll have a water leakage if your HVAC unit is not draining pipes properly. A constraint in your drain pipelines triggers a water leakage. There are several locations a clog can take place. Among the primary locations where clogs start to establish is inside your evaporator HVAC coil.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outside air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the need to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often done in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
