This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is generally oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered also.<p>
<p>Central air conditioning conditioners are more efficient than space a/c. In addition, they run out the way, peaceful, and convenient to run. To conserve energy and cash, you should try to buy an energy-efficient a/c unit and lower your central air conditioning conditioner's energy use. In a typical air-conditioned home, a/c takes in more than 2,000 kilowatt-hours of electrical energy each year, triggering power plants to produce about 3,500 pounds of carbon dioxide and 31 pounds of sulfur dioxide.<p>
