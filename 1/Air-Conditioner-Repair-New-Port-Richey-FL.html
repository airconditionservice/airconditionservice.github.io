<p>The quality of the air inside our schools, houses and work environments matters, particularly considering that we spend the majority of our lives indoors. Air conditioners help to dehumidify the inbound air, but in extremely humid climates or in cases where the air conditioning unit is large, it may not accomplish a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned house will increase your energy usage, both for the dehumidifier itself and due to the fact that the air conditioning system will need more energy to cool your home. A more suitable option is a dehumidifying heat pipeline, which can be added as a retrofit to a lot of existing systems.<p>
<p>More common in fairly older houses, a boiler-based heating system uses electrical energy, oil or gas to heat water and produce steam that moves through pipelines to heat radiators in private spaces. All-electric boilers can accomplish up to 95 to one hundred percent AFUE, according to the DOE. More recent gas boilers need to attain 80 percent AFUE and more recent fossil-fueled boilers should achieve a 75 percent AFUE.<p>
