<p>Indoor Air Quality Guide: Best Practices for Style, Construction and Commissioning is created for designers, design engineers, contractors, commissioning agents, and all other experts worried about indoor air quality. Sources of formaldehyde in the home include building products, smoking cigarettes, household products, and making use of unvented, fuel-burning home appliances, like gas stoves or kerosene space heating units. Formaldehyde, by itself or in combination with other chemicals, serves a variety of purposes in made products. For example, it is utilized to add permanent-press qualities to clothes and draperies, as an element of adhesives and glues, and as a preservative in some paints and finishing items.<p>
<p>There are many actions a house owner can take to select items that will prevent indoor air issues from occurring - a number of them are mentioned here. Initially, use exterior-grade pressed wood items made with phenol-formaldehyde resin in floorings, cabinets, and wall surface areas. Or, as an alternative, think about using solid wood products. Second of all, if you prepare to install wall-to-wall carpet on concrete in contact with the ground, especially concrete in basements, ensure that an effective wetness barrier is installed prior to installing the carpet. If it ends up being damp, do not completely adhere carpet to concrete with adhesives so that the carpet can be eliminated.<p>
