<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning help identify the effectiveness of dilution. Air modifications arise from a mix of natural ventilation (seepage; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate wetness, Air cleaning happens. The goal is to provide adequate changes to ensure a healthy environment. There are several kinds of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be set up to accomplish this. A typical aspect required in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) provides guidance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Design.<p>
