<p>Radiant heat covers a range of various heating systems, including electric heating systems and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heat systems operate on comparable principles. In the case of a boiler, the system heats up by dispersing warm water through a series of pipes set up in the sub-floor of each room. When it comes to electric radiant heat systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating elements. As the warm water (or electrical energy) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the floor and into the room.<p>
