<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might believe. Due to the fact that many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a small, low-cost versatile pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to wear and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
