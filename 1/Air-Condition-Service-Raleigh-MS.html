<p>I am replacing our High Speed System due to the fact that of a severe refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11. The installer will be using the above noted devices, a Provider, Convenience Series Single Stage Condenser, 31,000 BTUs. They are likewise installing an Unico single Phase Blower module, and a Unico Evaporator Coil, 31,000 BTUs and a 12 SEER.
