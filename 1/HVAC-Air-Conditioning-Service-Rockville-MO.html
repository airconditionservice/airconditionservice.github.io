<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a reasonably easy to measure surrogate for indoor contaminants discharged by people, and associates with human metabolic activity. Co2 at levels that are unusually high indoors may cause residents to grow sleepy, to get headaches, or to work at lower activity levels. Outdoor CO2 levels are generally 350-450 ppm whereas the maximum indoor CO2 level considered appropriate is 1000 ppm. 28 Human beings are the main indoor source of carbon dioxide in many structures. Indoor CO2 levels are a sign of the adequacy of outside air ventilation relative to indoor occupant density and metabolic activity.<p>
