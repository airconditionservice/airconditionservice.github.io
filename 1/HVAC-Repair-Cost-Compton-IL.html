<p>It's not instantly clear why Target would have given an HVAC company external network gain access to, or why that gain access to would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network. However according to a cybersecurity professional at a big seller who asked not to be called because he did not have consent to speak on the record, it is common for big retail operations to have a team that consistently keeps track of energy usage and temperature levels in stores to minimize costs (especially during the night) and to alert store managers if temperatures in the stores vary outside of an acceptable range that might prevent consumers from shopping at the shop.<p>
<p>Bear in mind, too, that you might want to speak to a Seattle HVAC contractor, as different heatpump units can have various heating and cooling capacities.
