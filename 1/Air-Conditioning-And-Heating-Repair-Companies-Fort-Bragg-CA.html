<p>I typically do not leave evaluations but wished to share my experience. You do not anticipate having to change your AC unit. Regrettably for us, we had no other alternative. What made me opt for this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert discussing my alternatives. After business hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and discuss alternatives. I arranged my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their method. We were referred by a household pal and now I will advise this company to my buddies.<p>
