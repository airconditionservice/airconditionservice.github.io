<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have really small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the auto debit, although my company does not offer auto debit numerous companies do so they can have a known amount of cash being available in every month, it assists with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. If we do decide to offer automobile debit we would likewise have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There must not be any reason why your company can not offer this. Hope this assists.<p>

<p>Current Review: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was educated and polite. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
