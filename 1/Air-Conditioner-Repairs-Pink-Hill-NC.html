<h3>The Way to Choose An HVAC Company in Pink Hill NC</h3>
<p>When building your brand-new house a well-functioning Cooling and heating system is essential, in addition to the air quality you breathe inside. We have the experience and resources needed to help from the planning phases through to the final installation. We utilize the most recent software application to help design your ductwork system and utilize the greatest quality products in the building and construction and installation.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the demand to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
