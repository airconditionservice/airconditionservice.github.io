<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't lucrative you would not provide them.  Second of all like prolonged automobile service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is really unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the necessary abilities to do the job and also the morals to treat clients fairly. As a client you need to be well informed in order not to be completely taken advantage of. Most companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to properly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to offer new versus repair. Finally discovered somebody to appropriately service and the unit has been running problem complimentary for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
