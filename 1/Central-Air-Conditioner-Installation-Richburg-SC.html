<p>Airflow patterns in structure are identified by the combined forces of mechanical ventilation systems, human activity, and natural impacts. Atmospheric pressure differences developed by these forces move air-borne toxins from areas of greater pressure to locations of lower pressure through any available opening in building walls, ceilings, floors, doors, windows, and HVAC systems. Even if the opening is small, air will move up until the inside pressure amounts to the exterior.<p>
<p>Specific types of HVAC units are a little more costly than wall units, ceiling or cassette systems are neatly hidden inside the ceiling in the class and are therefore more discreet and visually pleasing to look at. They supply effective air flow and are considerably more powerful than standard wall systems and can, for that reason, reduce the variety of systems needed and this can decrease installation and or replacement costs where numerous HVAC units are needed. Ducted commercial-grade a/c systems are BETTER for the educational environment. They are typically the most expensive alternative; however, they are also the most visually pleasing as the duct-work and internal systems hidden with minimal presence.<p>
