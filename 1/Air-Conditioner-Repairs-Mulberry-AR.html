<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Radiant heat systems have actually been around because the days of the Romans when they laid a network of pipelines under their marble floorings and connected them into a hot water supply. Romans used a wood-fired boiler tended by slaves and an elementary pumping device to distribute warm water that warmed their stone floorings. In turn, the uniformity of the floor heat transferred heat to other short articles in the spaces, consisting of the human occupants.<p>
<p>The term radiant heating covers a number of different system types. Most common are boilers, which are termed hydronic radiant heating systems, and electric systems, which are often described as just radiant systems. Electric radiant heat systems have heating aspects installed in the subfloor of each space in the house, sometimes connected to terminal units like baseboard heating units. When the system remains in usage, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating elements throughout the house. Heat radiates out from the heating elements, through the flooring, and into the room. This is why the approach is described as radiant heating.<p>
