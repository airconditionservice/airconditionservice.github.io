<p>An undersize system won't be able to cool rooms down completely on the most popular days and will cost more to operate because it needs to run longer than a correctly sized system. Because it just takes more electrical power to run a larger system, an oversize compressor also costs more to run. And a large-scale system doesn't lower humidity efficiently. That's since it cools the air so quickly that it shuts off before it has a possibility to distribute the proper volume of air past the coils to extract the needed wetness. The result is a space that does not seem as cool as the temperature indicates. In truth, the room can feel clammy and moist.<p>
