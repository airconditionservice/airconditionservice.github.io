<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't lucrative you wouldn't provide them.  Second of all like extended auto warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is really sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the needed skills to do the task and also the morals to deal with consumers fairly. As a customer you require to be well notified in order not to be completely made the most of. The majority of companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to correctly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to sell new versus repair. Finally discovered somebody to appropriately service and the unit has actually been running issue free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
