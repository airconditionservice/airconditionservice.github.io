<p>To state there are a great deal of variables in setting up solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the air conditioner back into its initial box, using the dense-foam packing material to safeguard it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware products in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in package. Set package in a cool, dry place for the winter. And if the storage room has a concrete floor, location two 2x4s underneath package to raise it up and safeguard it from wetness.<p>
<p>An AC unit maintenance cost can be $50 to $110 for a single check out, or you can sign up for a maintenance strategy with your local heating and air conditioning company. That will cost about $150 to $300 a year. You'll get a couple of maintenance check outs annually, plus another service call, a discount on parts, and usually some other advantages. Some companies provide concern consultations to their maintenance plan members.<p>

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 entered into force in 2000 and prohibited making use of ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Policy banned the use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This indicates that equipment that utilizes R22 can still operate, as long as it does not leakage. Although R22 is now prohibited, systems that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and maintained.<p>
