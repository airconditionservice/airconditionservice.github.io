<p>Asthmatic children are specifically at threat. EPA estimates that direct exposure to secondhand smoke increases the number of episodes and severity of symptoms in hundreds of countless asthmatic kids, and might trigger countless nonasth-matic kids to establish the illness each year. EPA estimates that between 200,000 and 1,000,000 asthmatic children have their condition intensified by exposure to secondhand smoke each year.

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning help identify the efficiency of dilution.

Air cleaning takes place when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate wetness. The goal is to provide adequate modifications to make sure a healthy environment. There are several types of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be set up to achieve this. A common aspect essential in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies guidance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Style.<p>
