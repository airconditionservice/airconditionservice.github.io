<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a requirement for a/c repair, which you must look out for. Initially, you need to check your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis.

This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air.

If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
