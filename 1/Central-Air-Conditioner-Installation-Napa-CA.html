<p>The instructions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfortable finishing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat.

As soon as the wiring is complete, stimulate the system for a couple of minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable television heats up. Do not put the system into complete operation till the thin-set and grout have actually had time to properly treat and solidify-- normally two to 4 weeks. Then call the family together and play a game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm restroom floor.<p>
