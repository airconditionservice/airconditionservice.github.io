<p>All heating unit have some level of air purification. From one of the most standard, 1-inch filter in the blower cabinet, to the larger, 4-inch media filter often in its own cabinet outside the furnace, to the more sophisticated electronic air cleaners and air cleansers, all need some standard maintenance. These filters assist with indoor air quality by trapping air-borne pollutants streaming through your system. They can also keep your system carrying out well by helping reduce the accumulation of dust, dirt and other particles from accumulating on internal components like the blower motor, burners and heat exchanger.<p>
<p>Start by raising the lower sash, and then measure the height and width of the opening. When going shopping for an air conditioner to guarantee it'll fit easily into the window, be sure to have those measurements on hand.
