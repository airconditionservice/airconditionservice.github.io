<p>Keep in mind, too, that you might wish to speak with a Seattle HVAC contractor, as various heatpump units can have various heating and cooling capacities. If you currently have a home heating system, you may try to find a heat pump more tailored towards cooling capacity and efficiency. For a higher-end design to take care of your heating and cooling needs, you'll naturally want to try to find a model that will have enough heating for the cold Seattle winters.

<p>It is common to assume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively steady in time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a structure as relatively the same physical material in time. In truth, the true nature of buildings can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be explained and understood as complex systems. Research study applying the methods ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
