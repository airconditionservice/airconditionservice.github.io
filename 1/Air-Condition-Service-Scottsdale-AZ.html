Numerous standard units break down after just four hours of extreme vibration testing, while the Brisk II is still going strong at 30 hours and more! The galvanized steel leading plate provides long lasting strength while long copper lines lessen vibration and, for that reason, noise too. While being one of the most difficult ac system around, its 410A refrigerant is kinder to the environment. Robust, light-weight and capable of performing in any environment! It won't let you down.<p>
<p>Many well and city water does not usually include lead. Water normally picks up lead inside the home from home plumbing that is made with lead materials.
