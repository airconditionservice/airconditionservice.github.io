<p>As many of you discussed, preventative maintenance is needed by all significant equipment maker's to ensure your factory guarantees stay in place. Additionally, the tangible results of a PM is often tough to quantify, as one action stated the savings in effectiveness or repairs that were prevented. Many pieces of a furnace or a/c unit don't just break at the breeze of a finger, but instead is the result of repeated use of a component that is out of balance. For example, a heat exchanger might stop working too soon because the gas pressure was operating to high, cooking the metal and triggering premature degeneration, causing cracks and holes. If that client had actually gotten a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure stays in line and safeguards the element.  a really advantageous result and one that was no cost at the time of service, but one that possibly saved a client thousands.<p>
