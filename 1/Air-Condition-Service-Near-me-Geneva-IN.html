<p>Recent Review: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and polite. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>

<h3>Heating Installation in Geneva IN</h3>
<p>There are 2 main forms of radiant floor heating, or RFH as it's known in the home heating organisation. One is hydronic where water or a particular fluid like glycol is warmed by some kind of a fuel-fired boiler and is then circulated through a piping system under the flooring surface. The second is by electric radiator panels where the electric wires or cables set under the floor are forced to withstand current, which then creates heat.<p>
