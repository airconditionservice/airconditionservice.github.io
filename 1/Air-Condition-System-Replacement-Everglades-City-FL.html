You have a great Tech PM your system, he is paying bills and should not "need" to sell you something you do not need. Your $1500 UV light is something you were offered on.

<h3>The Most Common Causes of Blocked Ducts in HVAC Systems</h3>
<p>Since things ran smoothly without any noise, I was extremely happy in the beginning. Moreover, I saw visible modifications in my electrical energy costs. After 2 years, things began to change. There have actually been uncomfortable noises. I got it repaired and examined. I am hoping that is the end of the problem. Overall, it has actually been a good experience. Reliable on the whole. Neat operation and great cooling system. Yes, I was not happy with its appearances in the beginning. However then understood Air conditioners are for cooling and not for beautification.<p>
<p>Changing a capacitor is simple. Simply take a picture of the wires prior to detaching anything (you might need a reference in the future). Then discharge the kept energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp connectors ought to snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. If it's not, get rid of the connector and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you have actually switched all the wires, protect the brand-new capacitor (Photo 5).<p>
