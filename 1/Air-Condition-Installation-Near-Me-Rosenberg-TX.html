<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Disease is caused by a waterborne germs Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The primary route of exposure is through the creation of an aerosol effect, most typically from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A typical source of Legionella in commercial buildings is from improperly put or maintained evaporative cooling towers, which typically launch water in an aerosol which may enter nearby ventilation intakes. Outbreaks in medical centers and nursing homes, where patients are immuno-suppressed and immuno-weak, are the most typically reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has included outdoor water fountains in public destinations. The existence of Legionella in commercial structure water materials is highly under-reported, as healthy individuals need heavy exposure to get infection.<p>
