<p>We are OPEN as an "Important Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds amazing, but furnace technicians typically find that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be switched on. Look for a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Examine the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace also.

<p>Air conditioner producers usually make rugged, high quality items. If your a/c stops working, begin by inspecting any fuses or breaker. Let the unit cool off for about 5 minutes before resetting any breakers. If a central air conditioner's compressor stops on a hot day, the high-pressure limitation switch might have tripped; reset it by pushing the button, located in the compressor's access panel.<p>
