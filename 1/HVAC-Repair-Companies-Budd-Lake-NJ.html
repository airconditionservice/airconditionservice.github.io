<p>Lead has actually long been acknowledged as a harmful environmental pollutant.

Airborne lead enters the body when an individual breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has settled.

<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a need for a/c unit repair, which you must watch out for. First, you must check your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little ridiculous, but ice on your ac system can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately if totally iced over.<p>
