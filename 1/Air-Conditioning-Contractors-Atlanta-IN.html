<p>Central air systems are measured in heaps. This measurement is based on the system's ability to cool your home. For instance, a 1 heap system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 increase in lots, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This suggests a 4.5 ton unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't familiar with the term BTU, it implies the amount of energy required to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F °.<p>
<p>When you purchase a brand-new cooling and heating system, you're purchasing your house, your family, and your business.

<p>People working in structures with poor IAQ might notice unpleasant or musty odors or may feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some workers grumble about symptoms that occur at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more serious issue. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ problems. If you have symptoms that are not going away or are worsening, talk with your medical professional about them. However not all direct exposures trigger symptoms, so there is no substitute for excellent structure management.<p>
