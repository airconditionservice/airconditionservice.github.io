They came and said it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the task, but they had to purchase it. My partner stated that she had seen a fantastic review for James, so I called. He came in a few hours (weaving a mask) and explained the situation to me. He stated it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 overall. He offered to come back today, however I moved it to tomorrow. James is among the best, most good individuals I have actually met in a very long time. If we wish to have alternatives to ACME heating, we require to support the real people who are there for us.
