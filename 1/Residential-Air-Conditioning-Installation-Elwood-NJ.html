<p>Most residential heating, ventilation, and a/c (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The present trend in home construction is to reduce air leakage through fractures and other openings in roofs, floors, and walls.

The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside makeup air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living areas of residential structures. The ASHRAE guidelines for makeup air for bathroom and kitchens in houses are much higher. This fresh make-up air helps and waters down indoor pollutants exhaust them from the house.<p>
