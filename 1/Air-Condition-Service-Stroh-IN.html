<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel often receives requests for consultation and assistance in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal firms.

<h3>Wall Air Conditioner in Stroh IN</h3>
<p>Wow - just wow. I never ever have become aware of the $5000 guideline but got ta provide whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one indoors and never requires maintenance and one outdoors and requires yearly and even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outside furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to buy stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than purchase something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are just insane and all over the location and I think they know they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
