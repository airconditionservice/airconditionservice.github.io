<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an exceptional job finding the outdoor unit as near the house as possible per my request. The job took two days and my yard and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was really knowledgeable of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained up until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>As a number of you mentioned, preventative maintenance is required by all major devices producer's to ensure your factory service warranties stay in place.

For example, a heat exchanger may stop working too soon because the gas pressure was running to high, preparing the metal and triggering early wear and tear, leading to fractures and holes. , if that client had actually received a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure remains in line and secures the component.. an extremely advantageous result and one that was no charge at the time of service, however one that possibly saved a client thousands.<p>
