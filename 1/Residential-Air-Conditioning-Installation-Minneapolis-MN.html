<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might think. Due to the fact that many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, affordable flexible hose) instead of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and use and is quickly pierced.<p>
<p>Since the 1980s, producers of HVAC equipment have been making an effort to make the systems they produce more efficient. This was initially driven by rising energy costs, and has actually more just recently been driven by increased awareness of ecological issues.

There are numerous approaches for making HVAC systems more effective.<p>
<p>Every personal residence and small company needs the services of competent professionals trained in the installation, maintenance, and repair of cooling, refrigeration, and heater.

<p>Second, recognition of pollutant sources is frequently important to identifying the cause( s) of employee health symptoms. Such info can often be acquired by requesting copies of air tracking information from the employer. If keeping an eye on data is not offered, yet a high number of health signs have actually been reported, the Union agent must request that the company have air monitoring tests carried out. Evaluation of this data might determine potentially hazardous sources of contamination and resultant worker health symptoms. However, when contaminant concentrations are really low, monitoring information may not explain the observed or reported health signs.<p>
