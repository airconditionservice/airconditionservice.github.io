<h3>What You Need to Know About Air Conditioner Repair in Bensalem PA</h3>
<p>Most residential heating, ventilation, and a/c (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The current pattern in house building and construction is to lower air leakage through cracks and other openings in roofs, walls, and floorings. The combination of these building practices and the recirculation of indoor air has actually led to a boost in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor make-up air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living areas of residential structures. The ASHRAE guidelines for makeup air for kitchens and bathrooms in homes are much higher. This fresh make-up air helps and waters down indoor pollutants exhaust them from the home.<p>
<p>Since an a/c moves heat between the indoor coil and the outside coil, both should be kept clean. This means that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is likewise needed to routinely clean up the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will ultimately lead to harm to the compressor, due to the fact that the condenser coil is accountable for discharging both the indoor heat (as gotten by the evaporator) and the heat produced by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
