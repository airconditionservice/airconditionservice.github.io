<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature level is frequently in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps become ineffective in more extreme cold. This is since ice forms on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system need to briefly change back into the regular cooling mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered just in this mode in order to make up for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
