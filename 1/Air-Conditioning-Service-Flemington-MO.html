<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a requirement for air conditioning unit repair, which you must look out for. Initially, you ought to examine your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little unreasonable, but ice on your air conditioning unit can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
