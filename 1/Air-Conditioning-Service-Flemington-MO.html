<h3>Home Air Conditioning Company in Flemington MO</h3>

<p>G&S did an exceptional task installing our new furnace and AC unit. The very best feature of G&S is that they service warranty for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace failed within a number of months (no fault of G&S). Manufacturers guarantee would cover the parts cost but G&S repaired and covered labor cost under their guarantee.

<p>Circuit Board Replacement: Ã¢ $ " Ã Many heating systems have multiple control panel. The largest, or only one in some heating systems, is in some cases called the Motherboard. The circuit boards control and coordinate the operation of the motors, sensing units, ignitor, gas valve and more. DIY repair is possible, but the new control panel need to be set up precisely right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonÃ¢ $ t work. Plus, if the concern isnÃ¢ $ t properly detected, changing a board wonÃ¢ $ t repair it, and boards are not returnable when set up. ItÃ¢ $ s wise to leave this repair to a professional to detect.<p>
<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a requirement for air conditioning unit repair, which you must look out for. Initially, you ought to examine your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little unreasonable, but ice on your air conditioning unit can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
