<h3>HVAC Systems Are a Must for All Homes and Offices in Pomona CA</h3>
<p>Lots of Canadian jurisdictions do not have particular legislation that deals with indoor air quality problems. In the absence of such legislation, the "basic responsibility stipulation" applies. This clause, typical to all Canadian occupational health and wellness legislation, mentions that an employer needs to offer a safe and healthy  workplace. Thus, ensuring the air is of excellent quality is the employer's duty.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outside air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the demand to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often carried out in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
