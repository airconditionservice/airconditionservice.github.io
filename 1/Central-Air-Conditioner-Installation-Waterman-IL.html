<p>Current Review: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He took the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and courteous. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
