<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might think. Due to the fact that most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, low-cost versatile hose pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to tear and wear and is easily pierced.<p>
<p>Use experts and treat them well: Encouraged, well-compensated experts perform much better work than short-term subcontractors who have little stake in a company's success.
