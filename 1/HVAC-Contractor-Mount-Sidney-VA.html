<p>Sean was extremely helpful. He is a very pleasant individual to deal with. No pressure used to purchase extra things. Addressed all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He was able to put surge protectors on the unit and do the full maintenance on the unit. that was to make certain they were no concerns aside from the blower motor. The only factor he could not set up the new blower motor was due to the fact that there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he knows for sure what the issue is.<p>
