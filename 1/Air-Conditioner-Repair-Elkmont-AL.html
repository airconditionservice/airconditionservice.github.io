<p>Due to the existing Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to help keep your house's Indoor Air Quality at its finest. The ability to cool and heat your home at optimal effectiveness will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is presently and the size of your house. A 2500 square foot house will need a much bigger AC system than a smaller home, which will impact installation costs. Also a home with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no fractures for air circulation will need far less AC capability to keep temperature levels comfy. Other factors that can impact this might be the insulation in other places such as the foundation, roof, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent task finding the outside system as near your home as possible per my request. The task took two days and my lawn and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely well-informed of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
