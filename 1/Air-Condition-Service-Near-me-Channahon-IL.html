<h3>Air Conditioner Repair in Channahon IL</h3>
<p>We got in touch with Elite HEATING AND COOLING on one of the most popular days of summer( we had no central air for 2weeks) and they sent out some1 out very same day to assess situation & decided to opt for them for the work. I more than happy to state that not just did we get the central air conditioning going however likewise changed the heating unit which was old. Everybody we spoke with from beginning to end were very expert, polite and the work was extremely efficiently done. I would highly suggest this company.<p>
<p>Ask about training and accreditations. A good location to begin is the North American Technician Quality (NATE) certification. It's kind of a minimum requirement for choosing an HVAC company, but a lot of contractors out there haven't bothered with it! Kick it up a notch by looking for Building Performance Institute (BPI) accreditation. Managers with BPI certification know that the home is a system and see HVAC devices as just one element (out of numerous) of a comfy environment.<p>
<p>When I called Gregg at 9:00 pm when our 2 furnaces were not working, stability Energy was fast to react. They showed up the next day and changed 2 furnaces and make them work.

Truthfully, our house heater is made complex, Rob and his team fixed the old duct work, changed all the dampers, make the entire system work completely.<p>
