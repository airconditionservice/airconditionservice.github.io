<p>Heating is the biggest energy cost in the average house. In extremely dry climates, evaporative coolers, often referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness throughout heat. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a damp pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the inbound air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature of the inbound air is decreased, but it is also more damp, so the total heat (reasonable heat plus latent heat) is unchanged.

If your home already has ducts, changing your heating system with a new, effective gas furnace is a relatively straightforward process. Installing a new gas furnace system can be quite expensive if you are including on to your house or retrofitting a house without ducting.<p>
