<h3>HVAC Maintenance in Stanford CA</h3>
<p>Fact: Geothermal systems really take in no water. If an aquifer is utilized to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is returned to that same aquifer.

During the assessment on a really cold day they eliminated the furnace declaring health threat reason and contractor laws for their choice.
