<p>Central air systems are measured in heaps. This measurement is based on the unit's capability to cool your house. For instance, a 1 lot system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 boost in heaps, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This indicates a 4.5 ton unit will cool 54,000 BTUs.
