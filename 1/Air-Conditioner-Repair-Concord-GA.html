<h2>How To Hire Certified HVAC Companies in Concord</h2>

<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel often receives requests for consultation and help in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal companies. Throughout the 1970s, numerous house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation measure. Nevertheless, a lot of these houses were discovered to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this item. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was installed many years back are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
