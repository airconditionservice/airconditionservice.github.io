<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as a result of human tenancy, however lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of carbon dioxide to quasi "stable state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. For that reason, measurements of co2 for purposes of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended duration of constant tenancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in offices at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible sign of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to measure carbon dioxide must be adjusted regularly, and outdoor measurements used for estimations need to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature effects on measurements made outdoors might likewise be needed.<p>
<p>Integrity Energy was quick to respond when I called Gregg at 9:00 pm when our 2 furnaces were not working. They appeared the next day and replaced 2 heaters and make them work. Bryson and Rob worked from 10:00 am to 8:00 pm on Friday up until the new heating systems can heat your house. Truthfully, our home heating unit is complicated, Rob and his group fixed the old duct, changed all the dampers, make the entire system work completely.<p>
<p>Second, recognition of impurity sources is frequently important to determining the cause( s) of worker health signs. Such information can sometimes be acquired by requesting copies of air monitoring information from the employer. If monitoring data is not available, yet a high variety of health symptoms have actually been reported, the Union representative should ask for that the company have air tracking tests performed. Evaluation of this data may identify possibly harmful sources of contamination and resultant employee health symptoms. Nevertheless, when impurity concentrations are really low, keeping an eye on data might not explain the observed or reported health signs.<p>
