<h3>Frequent Reasons For Air Conditioning Repair Calls in Duluth GA</h3>
<p>Throughout winter season, the ground source heat is taken in by pumping an anti-freeze and water-based  solution through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid circulates around this loop, sending the soaked up heat to a refrigerant by means of the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas. From here it goes through the compressor, increasing the temperature level of the gas as a direct outcome of the compression process. From here, the gas relocates to the condenser, which moves the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heating unit.<p>
