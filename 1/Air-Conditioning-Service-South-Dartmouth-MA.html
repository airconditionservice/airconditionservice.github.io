<h3>What is HVAC? HVAC Information For South Dartmouth MA Home Owners</h3>
<p>All contemporary a/c systems, even little window plan units, are geared up with internal air filters. These are usually of a light-weight gauze-like material, and should be changed or washed as conditions warrant.

Failure to change these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat currency exchange rate, resulting in squandered energy, shortened devices life, and higher energy bills; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air circulation. Additionally, really unclean or plugged filters can cause overheating during a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or even fire.<p>
<p>Oil furnaces tend to be higher in maintenance than other types. They produce a lot of soot, which needs to be effectively vented and cleaned up from the furnace frequently.

Expect to service your furnace annual at a cost of around $200, alter your filters every 1 - 3 months, and clean your ducts every 3 - 4 years to keep your system running optimally.<p>
