<p>A clogged up furnace filter can trigger a furnace to shut down. Unclean filters are the most common reason for furnace problems. Dust and dirt restrict airflow-- and if the filter gets too blocked, the heat exchanger will overheat and shut off too quickly, and your house will not heat up. If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, replace the filter. A dirty filter also causes soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, reducing the effectiveness of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>
