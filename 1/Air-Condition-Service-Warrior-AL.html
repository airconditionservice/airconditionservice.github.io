<p>I'll start with a gas furnace because it's the most common heating system in Seattle houses. Warm air is provided to the rooms of your home via ducts, and cool air is collected through cold air return vents. Gas heaters are rated for efficiency. Older systems from the 1970s may be rated 65%, meaning 35% of the heating energy is squandered during the combustion procedure. Today's models vary from a minimum of 78% as much as 98.5%. If your house already has ducts, changing your heating system with a brand-new, effective gas furnace is a fairly uncomplicated process.
