Initially, you ought to examine your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little unreasonable, but ice on your air conditioning system can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system.

If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly.<p>
