<p>Indoor Air Quality Guide: Best Practices for Design, Construction and Commissioning is designed for designers, design engineers, contractors, commissioning representatives, and all other experts worried about indoor air quality. Sources of formaldehyde in the home consist of structure materials, cigarette smoking, household products, and the use of unvented, fuel-burning home appliances, like gas ranges or kerosene area heating systems. Formaldehyde, by itself or in mix with other chemicals, serves a number of purposes in made products. For example, it is used to add permanent-press qualities to clothes and draperies, as an element of adhesives and glues, and as a preservative in some paints and covering items.<p>
<p>When filters aren't changed or cleaned routinely, they can become obstructed with particles that can restrict airflow, possibly affecting your convenience and your system's efficiency.

By comparison, replacing a furnace and checking filter can typically be performed in simply a couple of minutes, frequently without any tools required. As a safety measure, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, make certain to turn off the furnace either at the thermostat or utilizing the power switch, normally installed on the side of the furnace.<p>
