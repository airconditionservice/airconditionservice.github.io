<p>An indoor air pollutant is a substance in the air that might impact the health of individuals who reside in the house. Pollutants could originate from outside the home-- such as an idling automobile engine in a connected garage, backyard garbage burning, or radon entering your house from the ground listed below. An air pollutant could likewise come from inside the home-- such as carbon monoxide gas from a defective furnace, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from a newly painted space, pre-owned smoke, mold growing on damp or damp carpeting, or chemicals from pastimes, family cleaning, or personal care products. Viruses and germs, pet dander, and insect parts (allergen or roaches) are other possible indoor air toxins.<p>

Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels may present dangers, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air consisting of radon. Major health organizations (like the Centers for Disease Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes countless preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number might range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. Your risk of lung cancer is specifically high if you smoke and your house has high radon levels.<p>
