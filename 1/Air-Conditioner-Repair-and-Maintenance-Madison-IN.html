Localized radiant flooring heat systems to be used in one or several rooms like restrooms, kitchens or laundry rooms are quickly refurbished with electric glowing flooring heat. This is far more cost-efficient on a smaller sized scale. Larger restorations like additions to a house may be suitable for a bigger scale and more costly hydronic system.<p>
