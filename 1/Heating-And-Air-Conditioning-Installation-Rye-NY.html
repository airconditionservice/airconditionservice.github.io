<p>A packaged unit, usually installed on the roof, is most frequently used on commercial buildings, however it is also a choice for homeowners to consider. Many times, these units contain not just the air conditioning system itself but also a furnace. An advantage of this system is definitely the cost. Packaged units are great for those seeking to save cash on the installation of a brand-new heating & cooling system separately, given that the unit is combined. However, one con is that these units are generally only readily available for larger homes due to their high power and capability. Furthermore, while they can be a good way to conserve money on a complete HVAC system, they're still significantly more pricey than purchasing just a cooling system. For that reason, this might not be the very best option for property owners looking for short-term savings or those with smaller budgets.<p>
