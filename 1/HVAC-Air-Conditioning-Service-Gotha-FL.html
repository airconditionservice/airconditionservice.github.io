<p>Asthmatic children are especially at threat. EPA estimates that exposure to secondhand smoke increases the number of episodes and intensity of signs in hundreds of countless asthmatic children, and may trigger countless nonasth-matic kids to establish the disease each year. EPA estimates that in between 200,000 and 1,000,000 asthmatic kids have their condition intensified by direct exposure to secondhand smoke each year.

<p>Volatile natural compounds (VOCs)-- These are the main factors to bad indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both inside and outdoors. VOCs are natural chemicals produced as gases from processes or products; for the most part, you can smell their existence. Normal sources of VOCs inside your home include things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as apparently innocuous as a new carpet is most likely to be giving off formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outside might include unstable chemicals in polluted groundwater that are pulled inside throughout water use.<p>
<p>Practically half of Americans use air fresheners at least as soon as a week, and 34 percent use candles or incense that regularly, our nationally representative survey found. Approximately 40 percent rarely or never ever clean their humidifier or cooking area range hood, though they utilize it daily. One quarter have never cleaned up or changed their furnace filter. And almost 20 percent still smoke at home or let others smoke there. All of those things can intensify indoor air quality.<p>
