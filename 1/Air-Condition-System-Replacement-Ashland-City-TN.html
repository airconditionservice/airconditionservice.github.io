<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have really little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the car debit, although my company does not offer auto debit numerous companies do so they can have a known amount of cash coming in on a monthly basis, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. If we do choose to use car debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There should not be any reason that your company can not use this. Hope this helps.<p>
