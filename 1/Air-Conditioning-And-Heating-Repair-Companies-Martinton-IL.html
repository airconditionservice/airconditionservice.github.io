In really dry environments, evaporative coolers, sometimes described as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness throughout heat. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature of the inbound air is minimized, however it is likewise more humid, so the overall heat (reasonable heat plus hidden heat) is the same.

If the entering air is dry enough, the results can be rather substantial.<p>
