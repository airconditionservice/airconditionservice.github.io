The female crimp ports must snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight.

Plus, if the issue isnâ $ t appropriately identified, altering a board wonâ $ t repair it, and boards are not returnable when installed.

<p>Have actually utilized the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. They provide me priority and a lower rate when I have concerns. Bought a new main unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never buy extended guarantees or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Great investment in my viewpoint. Never ever try to sell me something I don't require.<p>
