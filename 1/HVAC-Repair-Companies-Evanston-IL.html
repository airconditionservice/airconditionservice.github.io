Likewise a house with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any cracks for air circulation will need far less AC capacity to keep temperatures comfy. Other factors that can affect this might be the insulation elsewhere such as the structure, roofing system, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>

<p>The likelihood of instant reactions to indoor air contaminants depends on numerous factors. Age and preexisting medical conditions are two important impacts. In other cases, whether a person reacts to a pollutant depends upon individual level of sensitivity, which differs greatly from individual to individual. Some people can end up being sensitized to biological pollutants after repeated direct exposures, and it appears that some people can become sensitized to chemical pollutants too.<p>
<p>While toxins frequently discovered in indoor air are accountable for numerous hazardous results, there is significant uncertainty about what concentrations or periods of exposure are essential to produce specific health problems. Individuals also respond extremely differently to direct exposure to indoor air contaminants. More research is required to much better understand which health effects occur after direct exposure to the typical pollutant concentrations found in houses and which happen from the higher concentrations that occur for brief time periods.<p>
