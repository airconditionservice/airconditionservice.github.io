<h3>HVAC Repair Quotes in Lemont IL</h3>
<p>My home has 5 systems, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" discovered something wrong with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned up for an extra $30.00. (He actually stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I got a refund and grumbled) When this guy belittled me for my "not understanding", I threw him off the property.<p>
<p>If the condenser coils are obstructed, the compressor can get too hot and shut down. You'll experience intermittent durations of very little cooling, followed by no cooling. Even if you're sure" the condenser coils are clean, tidy them once again. Switch off the power. Turn the cooling service and furnace breaker in your primary electrical panel to the Off" position. Next, switch off the power switch right at the furnace or air handler. Then yank the disconnect block (Photo 1) and tidy the condenser coils (Image 2). If the cooling service still doesn't work properly after you've cleaned the condenser coils, set up a brand-new filter and opened all the supply vents, proceed with the following repairs. Your AC won't work totally unless you do this.<p>

<p>I have been using them for several years for my organisations, my own houses and my realty clients' houses. I went through five other companies prior to I discovered Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All five other companies quoted me with various costs and various problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th person, who described to me completely the issues which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental house, another occasion. He helped me problem shoot the concern when I called and he advised me to call warranty which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the system working again.
