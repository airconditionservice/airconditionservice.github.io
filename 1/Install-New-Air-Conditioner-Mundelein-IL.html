<p>At present, EPA does not advise utilizing air cleaners to decrease levels of radon and its decay products. The efficiency of these devices is uncertain due to the fact that they just partially eliminate the radon decay items and do not lessen the quantity of radon entering the house. EPA plans to do additional research on whether air cleaners are, or could become, a reliable means of lowering the health risk from radon. EPA's brochure, Residential Air-Cleaning Gadgets, offers further details on air-cleaning devices to decrease indoor air pollutants.<p>
