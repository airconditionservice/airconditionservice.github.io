<h3>The Annals of Air Source Heat Pumps at North Wales PA</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Loan and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a federal government company, conducted a research study in the 1990s to examine 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it decreases energy costs by enhancing airflow. After evaluating 33 houses in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study discovered that there was no significant improvement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy performance. Sometimes, measured particle levels actually increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased immediately after cleaning however returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>4 Seasons has actually set up both of my heaters and air conditioners, cleaned the ducts and done the yearly servicing. I have found them to be reasonably priced, prompt and do fine work. When they installed my main furnace they went well beyond what was required and redid the whole plenum and the duct work for the hot water heater because the technicians thought they just didn't seem ideal and they could not leave them that way. No extra charge.<p>
