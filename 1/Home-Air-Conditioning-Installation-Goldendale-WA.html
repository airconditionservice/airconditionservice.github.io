<p>Utilizing a stove hood with a fan vented to the outdoors greatly lowers direct exposure to toxins during cooking. Incorrect change, typically shown by a consistent yellow-tipped flame, triggers increased contaminant emissions. Ask your gas company to change the burner so that the flame pointer is blue. If you buy a new gas range or variety, consider purchasing one with pilotless ignition because it does not have a pilot light that burns continuously. Never ever use a gas range to heat your home. When the fireplace is in use, constantly make particular the flue in your gas fireplace is open.<p>
