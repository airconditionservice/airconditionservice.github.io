<p>For a heated floor location less than 20 sq. ft., you might (for the most part) draw power from a surrounding GFCI-protected outlet without overwhelming the circuit. (If the thermostat you acquire is currently GFCI safeguarded like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad must be GFCI safeguarded.) However a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can cause overloads and annoyance circuit breaker trips. For our larger mat, we elected to install a devoted circuit with its own circuitry and breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are offered.<p>
<p>Ask about training and certifications. A great location to start is the North American Technician Quality (NATE) certification.

Supervisors with BPI certification understand that the house is a system and see HVAC devices as just one component (out of numerous) of a comfy environment.<p>

This means it can warm up your home to the wanted temperature level quicker than a heat pump can.<p>
