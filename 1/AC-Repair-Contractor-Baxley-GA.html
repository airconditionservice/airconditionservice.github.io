<p>Information offered in this safety guide is based upon existing scientific and technical understanding of the problems provided and is reflective of the jurisdictional borders developed by the statutes governing the co-authoring agencies. The requirements do not require you to alter your existing central air units, and replacement parts and services should still be readily available for your house's systems.

<p>If your central air conditioner will not cool but you can hear it running, it may simply need to be cleaned up. Whether this is the reason for the problem, it's a good early remedy to attempt.
