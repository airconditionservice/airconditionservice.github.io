Virtually all hydronic radiant flooring heat systems today use 1/2 inch size plastic tubing made from PEX or Cross-linked Polyethylene piping.

The heat exchanger enables air to be warmed without being available in contact with the real flame or burner area. Once it reaches an enough temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the house's duct, providing warm air to individual bedrooms, living spaces and cooking areas through the vents or signs up.<p>
