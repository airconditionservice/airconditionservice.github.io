<p>Truth: Federal and local incentives generally amount to in between 30 and 60 percent of overall geothermal system cost, which can typically make the initial cost of a system competitive with standard equipment. Standard air-source HVAC systems cost around $3,000 per lots of heating or cooling capacity, during brand-new building and construction (houses typically use between one and five loads). Geothermal HVAC systems start at about $5,000 per lot, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per heap. However, brand-new installation practices are reducing costs, to the point where the cost is getting closer to traditional systems under the ideal conditions.<p>
