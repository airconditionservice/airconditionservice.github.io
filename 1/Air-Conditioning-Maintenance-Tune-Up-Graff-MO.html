(If the thermostat you purchase is already GFCI safeguarded like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad must be GFCI protected.) But a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can trigger overloads and problem breaker journeys. For our larger mat, we chose to install a dedicated circuit with its own wiring and circuit breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are available.<p>
