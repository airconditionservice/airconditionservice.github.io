PTACs, which are frequently used in hotels, have two different units (terminal packages), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing system on the exterior, with an opening travelling through the wall and connecting them. This decreases the interior system footprint and allows each room to be changed independently. PTAC systems might be adapted to supply heating in winter, either directly by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heating unit, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to heat the interior and draw heat from the exterior air, converting the air conditioner into a heatpump While room cooling supplies optimum flexibility, when utilized to cool many spaces at a time it is usually more costly than central air conditioning.<p>
