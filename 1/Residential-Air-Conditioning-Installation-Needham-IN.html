<p>The effects of lead direct exposure on fetuses and young children can be serious. They consist of hold-ups in physical and psychological advancement, lower IQ levels, shortened attention periods, and increased behavioral problems. Fetuses, infants, and children are more vulnerable to lead direct exposure than grownups since lead is more quickly taken in into growing bodies, and the tissues of kids are more sensitive to the damaging impacts of lead. Children might have greater exposures because they are more likely to get lead dust on their hands and then put their fingers or other lead-contaminated items into their mouths.<p>
