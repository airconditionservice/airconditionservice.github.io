<h3>Heating Company in Slater SC</h3>
<p>Wow - just wow. I never have heard of the $5000 rule but got ta offer whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one indoors and never requires maintenance and one outdoors and requires yearly or even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outside furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of buy something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are simply insane and all over the place and I guess they know they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
<p>Additionally, radiators heat the air nearest them first, which is why rooms heated up by radiators are susceptible to cold spots", meaning that the air feels cold in the middle of the space and very hot beside the radiators. This usually results in opening a window above the radiator to bring some fresh air in, and there we go once again, letting all that energy paid to heat up the house escape out of the window. Convected heat provides warmth from the floor up throughout the space with no cold spots or stuffiness in the area being warmed.<p>
