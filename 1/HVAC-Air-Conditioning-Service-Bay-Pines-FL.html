<p>The predominant health impact connected with direct exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels may position risks, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Major health organizations (like the Centers for Disease Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes thousands of avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number could range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. Your danger of lung cancer is particularly high if you smoke and your house has high radon levels.<p>
