<p>Even if your central air conditioning conditioner is just 8 to 10 years old, it could grovel twice the electricity that even a low-end brand-new one would utilize. That's due to the fact that it operates at or listed below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Performance Ratio, which is the quantity of energy needed to offer a particular cooling output. Up until 2006, 10 SEER was standard, but these days, the minimum permitted by federal law is 13 SEER. That translates to 30% less electrical consumption and 30% lower cooling costs than devices set up simply a couple of years earlier.<p>
