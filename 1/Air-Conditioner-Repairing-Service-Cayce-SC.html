There is evidence that high concentrations or continued exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the risk of breathing infection; there is also evidence from animal research studies that repeated exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the development of lung illness such as emphysema. Individuals at specific danger from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide consist of kids and people with asthma and other respiratory illness.<p>
<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your car's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by flowing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation.
