<p>How climate change affects air quality and exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being kept at a set temperature level (which is a basic mode of operation for modern-day air conditioning system) requires that the rate of energy removal by the a/c increase. This boost has the effect that, for each system of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the a/c unit removes that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioning unit should increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "performance" (coefficient of performance) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is activated, and the air conditioning system has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The a/c unit's power usage will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, thus making the 100 W heating component cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
