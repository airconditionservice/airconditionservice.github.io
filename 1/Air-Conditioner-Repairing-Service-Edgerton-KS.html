<h3>Air Conditioning Contractors in Edgerton KS</h3>
<p>Wow - just wow. I never have actually become aware of the $5000 guideline but got ta offer whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heating systems - one inside your home and never ever needs maintenance and one outdoors and requires annual or perhaps bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to buy stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just insane and all over the place and I think they understand they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
<p>G&S did an outstanding job installing our brand-new furnace and AC system. The very best thing about G&S is that they warranty for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace stopped working within a couple of months (no fault of G&S). Manufacturers guarantee would cover the parts cost but G&S repaired and covered labor cost under their warranty. Also they detected the issue and repaired extremely rapidly. Certainly A++ installation and service.<p>
<p>Start by calling RJ Heating if your furnace stops working. We frequently find that a basic repair or adjustment is all that's needed to help it run appropriately again.
