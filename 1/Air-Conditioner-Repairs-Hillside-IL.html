<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 came into force in 2000 and prohibited using ozone diminishing HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Guideline banned the use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid).

<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to provide your home that ideal temperature level all year round. But while they're cycling through all that air, they're removing a few of those typical air pollutants. Eventually, their air filters fill and stop doing their task. Not only does that cause difficulty for your indoor air quality, it also wears down your AC system, which can cause costly repairs down the road. So, make sure to alter your AC filters routinely, or get an a/c service strategy which usually consists of a filter change - especially if you are allergy-prone or reside in a metropolitan area with high levels of pollution.<p>
<p>A packaged unit, generally set up on the roof, is most typically used on commercial structures, but it is also a choice for property owners to consider. Many times, these systems include not only the air conditioning system itself however also a furnace. An advantage of this unit is undoubtedly the cost. Packaged systems are fantastic for those aiming to save cash on the installation of a new heating and cooling system independently, because the unit is combined. Nevertheless, one con is that these systems are generally only available for larger houses due to their high power and capability.

Therefore, this might not be the best choice for house owners searching for short-term savings or those with smaller budget plans.<p>
