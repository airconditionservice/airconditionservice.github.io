<p>It is still possible that an indoor air pollution issue exists if no impurity sources are found. Excessive re-circulation of air leads to "stale air" conditions. Stagnant air has greater levels of co2 and carbon monoxide gas (produced from human breathing and cigarette smoke, respectively) than outdoors air.

<p>I have been working in HVAC for over 20 years. Now I am beginning my own HVAC company. I can tell you that it is a tough job that the employees sweat and bleed at, particularly residential service. When there is no work there is no pay. That is where PMs work, keeps us in touch with consumers and keeps men working. When a sales man concerns your house he exists to sell, that is the only way he is paid. You have a good Tech PM your system, he is paying costs and need to not "require" to offer you something you do not need. Your $1500 UV light is something you were sold on. For me, I provide you the alternatives for your requirements and you choose if you need it.<p>

<h3>What Exactly Are Inverted Heat Pumps in Bradley CA?</h3>
<p>So it turned out that everything they did was 100% assessment, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil modification' type of maintenance as I have actually read here). The heat exchanger had a really little bubble on the surface which the tech said 'could' cause a problem in the future. So he stated I might switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the same cost (it never broke).<p>

<p>Biological contaminants consist of germs, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and feline saliva, house dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these contaminants. Pollens stem from plants; viruses are sent by people and animals; bacteria are carried by individuals, animals, and soil and plant particles; and home pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a potent allergen. When it dries, it can end up being airborne. Polluted central air conditioning handling systems can end up being breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then disperse these pollutants through the house.<p>
