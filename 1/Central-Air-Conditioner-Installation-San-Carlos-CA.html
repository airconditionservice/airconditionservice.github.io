<h3>What is HVAC? HVAC Advice For San Carlos CA Home Owners</h3>
<p>Another approach to lowering the concentrations of indoor air pollutants in your house is to increase the amount of outside air coming inside. Most house heating and cooling systems, including forced air heater, do not mechanically bring fresh air into your house. Opening doors and windows, running window or attic fans, when the weather permits, or running a window ac system with the vent control open increases the outside ventilation rate. Local bathroom or kitchen fans that tire outdoors eliminate pollutants straight from the room where the fan lies and likewise increase the outside air ventilation rate.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and well-informed. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
