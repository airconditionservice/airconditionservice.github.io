<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a federal government agency, conducted a study in the 1990s to examine two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it decreases energy expenses by enhancing airflow. After checking 33 houses in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the research study discovered that there was no substantial enhancement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not enhance airflow or energy efficiency. In many cases, determined particle levels actually increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased immediately after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
