<p>We look at clues before we provide advice to replace instead of repair a heater. One of the clues we look at is the cost of energy. If energy costs are high compared to usage, or if energy costs are greater year after year, we understand the unit is not running efficiently. It may be in best condition, however if it costs you more in a year to run than it would cost to change it with a more efficient design, then you would be squandering money by not changing the older unit.<p>
<p>Air toxins can vary from contaminants brought in from the outdoors by your animals to harmful gas leakages.

In kitchen areas and bathrooms, mold and mildew can become an annoyance where wetness levels are normally higher than in the rest of your home.<p>
<p>Residents of houses with poor indoor air quality might suffer signs such as headache, eye inflammation, fatigue, dry throat, sinus dizziness, congestion, and queasiness.
