<h3>A Synopsis of Central Heating Systems in Cedar MN</h3>
<p>Throughout winter, the ground source heat is absorbed by pumping a water-based and anti-freeze solution through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid distributes around this loop, sending the soaked up heat to a refrigerant through the evaporator, altering it from a liquid to gas.

From here, the gas moves to the condenser, which moves the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heating unit.<p>
