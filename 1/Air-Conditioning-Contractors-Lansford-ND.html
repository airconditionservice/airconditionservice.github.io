<p>Because it's the most common heating system in Seattle houses, I'll start with a natural gas furnace. Warm air is delivered to the rooms of your home via ducts, and cool air is collected through cold air return vents. Gas furnaces are ranked for efficiency. Older systems from the 1970s may be rated 65%, indicating 35% of the heating energy is squandered throughout the combustion procedure. Today's designs range from a minimum of 78% as much as 98.5%. If your house already has ducts, changing your heating system with a brand-new, efficient gas furnace is a reasonably simple procedure. If you are adding on to your home or retrofitting a house without ducting, installing a new gas furnace system can be rather costly.<p>

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have very small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the automobile debit, although my company does not provide automobile debit many companies do so they can have a known quantity of money coming in every month, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. If we do decide to offer car debit we would likewise have a choice of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There should not be any reason why your company can not use this. Hope this assists.<p>
