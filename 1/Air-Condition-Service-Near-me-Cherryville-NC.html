<h3>Is The Furnace Running at Top Efficiency in Cherryville NC?</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was fantastic and on time. Josh was quick and extremely clear about his assessment, guaranteeing I comprehended what was looked out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So perhaps a little high on price for this service, however the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>
<p>Four Seasons has actually set up both of my heating systems and air conditioners, cleaned the ducts and done the annual servicing. I have actually discovered them to be reasonably priced, timely and do fine work. When they installed my main furnace they worked out beyond what was necessary and renovated the whole plenum and the duct work for the water heater because the service technicians thought they just didn't appear best and they couldn't leave them that method. No extra charge.<p>
